in 911 call , professor admits to shooting girlfriend
in a 911 call , his voice only slightly shaky , college professor shannon lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
lamb made a point to say his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on her phone .
inside the home , officers found amy prentiss &apos; body and a hand @-@ written note scribbled on a white legal pad : &quot; i am so very sorry i wish i could take it back i loved amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; read the letter authorities say was signed by lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who was teaching two online classes for delta state university in cleveland , mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school &apos;s campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well @-@ liked history professor , ethan schmidt , in the doorway to his office .
delta state university police chief lynn buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m .
he said lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that .
by the end of the day , there would be one more death : lamb took his own life as police closed in on him .
a day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated lamb .
the details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
students said they looked forward to his class .
police in gautier , where prentiss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
schmidt himself had included lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the &quot; wonderful people &quot; he shared his academic life with .
both taught in the division of social sciences and history , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclinations of problems .
a student who praised lamb , brandon beavers , said he also seemed agitated and jittery , &quot; like there was something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , mikel sykes , said lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
lamb had earlier asked delta state university for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
this year , he was only teaching two online classes .
recent changes in the university &apos;s hiring policies meant that the doctorate lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
university president william laforge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between lamb and schmidt but &quot; obviously there was something in mr. lamb &apos;s mind . &quot;
those are questions lamb can no longer answer .
after fleeing the campus , police later picked up lamb &apos;s trail when he crossed back into mississippi from arkansas .
before he could be apprehended , lamb killed himself with a single .38 @-@ caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of greenville , mississippi , said washington county coroner methel johnson .
his car was still running in the driveway .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to that home , though johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started working at the university , which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geography and education classes .
he received a doctorate in education in the spring .
one of lamb &apos;s longtime friends described him as smart , charismatic and funny .
carla hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
he was quite the heartthrob back then .
all the girls would melt when he was around , &quot; said hairston , now 40 and living in the jackson suburb of brandon .
lamb and prentiss had apparently been dating for some time .
in the 911 call , lamb said &quot; i killed my wife , &quot; but there was no record of them ever marrying .
they had a dog named lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in gautier .
police said the dog was ok .
prentiss &apos; ex @-@ husband , shawn o &apos;steen , said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who &apos;s now 19 .
&quot; she was completely devastated , &quot; o &apos;steen said of his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;steen said he had not met lamb but heard through his daughter abigail that lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met prentiss when he and abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
later , they played together in the occasional gig .
o &apos;steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
mike shaffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at the julep room , a dimly lit bar near gautier , said he last saw lamb and prentiss the night of sept . 5 , after lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd .
there was no sign of anything amiss .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were cutting up and throwing one @-@ liners at each other .
i mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
schmidt , the slain professor , directed the first @-@ year seminar program and specialized in native american and colonial history , said don allan mitchell , an english professor at the school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at emporia state university in kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government .
on the delta state campus in cleveland on tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a candlelight memorial .
schmidt &apos;s wife , liz , and brother jeff schmidt also attended the vigil , during which the university choir sang &quot; bright morning star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace . &quot;
classes resume wednesday .
&quot; we &apos;re trying to get our students to come back , &quot; laforge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
amy and rogelio solis reported from cleveland , mississippi .
associated press writers emily wagster pettus in greenville , mississippi , and rebecca santana in new orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying lamb made the 911 call after shooting schmidt , and that while lamb referred to prentiss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .

michael j. fox jokes about his &apos; date &apos; with princess diana
the premiere of &quot; back to the future &quot; was a huge moment for michael j. fox professionally .
it was noteworthy because of personal reasons , too .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and i realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it dawns on me that princess diana is going to be sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary , &quot; back in time . &quot;
the movie starts and it occurs to me that i &apos;m a fake yawn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with the princess of wales .
&quot; back in time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; back to the future , &quot; features interviews with fox , lea thompson , and christopher lloyd , as well as director robert zemeckis , and executive producer steven spielberg .

un chief says there is no military solution in syria
secretary @-@ general ban ki @-@ moon says his response to russia &apos;s stepped up military support for syria is that &quot; there is no military solution &quot; to the nearly five @-@ year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people .
the u.n. chief again urged all parties , including the divided u.n. security council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban told a news conference wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the u.s. , russia , china , britain and france - on the sidelines of the general assembly &apos;s ministerial session later this month to discuss syria .
he expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the syrian people and regional powers &quot; made this situation unsolvable . &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an iran nuclear deal in addressing the syria crisis .
8 poll numbers that show donald trump is for real
some have tried to label him a flip @-@ flopper .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are holding out for an implosion .
but no matter how some republicans are trying to drag donald trump down from atop the polls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown donald trump &apos;s lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul &apos;s nomination chances .
of course , it &apos;s still early in the election cycle .
none of this is to say that trump is likely to win the republican nomination .
pundits point out that at this time in 2011 , rick perry &apos;s lead was giving way to a rising herman cain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
and there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
but outside groups like jeb bush &apos;s super pac and the economic conservative group club for growth are recognizing trump &apos;s staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn &apos;t just a passing phase :
trump &apos;s favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
right before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid @-@ june , a monmouth university poll showed only two in 10 republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul .
by mid @-@ july , it was 40 percent .
in early august , it was 52 percent .
now , six in 10 republicans have a favorable view of donald trump .
roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
and these numbers hold up in early states .
a quinnipiac poll in iowa last week found that 60 percent of republicans there had a favorable view of trump .
two @-@ thirds of gop voters would be happy with trump as the nominee .
in a cnn / orc poll last week , 67 percent of republicans said they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if trump were the nominee .
only two in 10 say they would be &quot; upset &quot; if he were the nominee .
only ben carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as trump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same of trump ) .
the next closest in enthusiasm ?
marco rubio with only 21 percent .
on the flip side , 47 percent of republican voters say they would be &quot; dissatisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if establishment favorite jeb bush becomes the nominee .
a majority of republicans don &apos;t see trump &apos;s temperament as a problem .
while donald trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults , 52 percent of leaned republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president , according to monday &apos;s abc news / washington post poll .
the same number holds in the first @-@ in @-@ the @-@ nation caucus state of iowa , where the same 52 percent of republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to quinnipiac last week .
still , 44 percent think he doesn &apos;t have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the white house , according to abc / post .
republican voters are getting used to the idea .
when they put on their pundit hats , republican voters think trump is for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the gop nomination , four in 10 said trump was the best bet , according to a cnn / orc poll out last week .
that &apos;s a change from when four in 10 placed their money on jeb bush in late july .
full disclosure : gop voters haven &apos;t had the clearest crystal ball in the past .
at this time last cycle , four in 10 republicans picked rick perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee mitt romney .
still , it shows that a plurality of gop voters see trump &apos;s campaign as plausible .
even if republicans rallied around another candidate , trump still beats almost everyone .
some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to trump &apos;s lead , while anti @-@ trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates .
but a monmouth university poll in early september shows that , in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head matchup between trump and most other republican candidates , trump almost always garners majority support .
he leads carly fiorina by 13 points , marco rubio by 14 points , walker by 15 points , jeb bush by 19 points , and , finally , rand paul , john kasich and chris christie by 33 points each .
he &apos;s in a dead heat with ted cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
ben carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head @-@ to @-@ head .
a bare majority of donald trump &apos;s supporters say they &apos;ve made up their minds .
a new cbs / nyt poll out on tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support trump say they have locked in their votes .
obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates .
still , trump &apos;s strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon ben carson , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for trump .
six in 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration .
even since donald trump called immigrants from mexico &quot; rapists &quot; in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation .
some are worried that trump &apos;s bombast will drive crucial hispanic voters away from the republican party and damage rebranding efforts .
but according to monday &apos;s new abc / post poll , six in 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration issues .
so as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems donald trump will remain too .
frustration with government is climbing to new highs .
donald trump and ben carson now account for roughly half of the support from republican voters , largely due to their outsider status .
six in 10 republicans in monday &apos;s new abc / post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience .
and they are angry at washington , too .
a des moines register / bloomberg poll in iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four iowa republicans are frustrated with republicans in congress , with 54 percent &quot; unsatisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; mad as hell . &quot;
jeremy corbyn to make debut at prime minister &apos;s questions
since his election , mr corbyn &apos;s debut at pmqs has been keenly awaited
new labour leader jeremy corbyn is to make his debut at prime minister &apos;s questions later , taking on david cameron for the first time .
mr corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and labour mps .
he has called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at the weekly showpiece .
he has also said he could skip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test of mr corbyn &apos;s leadership , coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the tuc annual congress on tuesday .
meanwhile , the labour leader &apos;s decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the battle of britain has attracted criticism from a number of tory mps and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
mr corbyn &apos;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said he had &quot; stood in respectful silence &quot; and did recognise the &quot; heroism of the royal air force in the battle of britain . &quot;
but a member of mr corbyn &apos;s shadow cabinet , owen smith , told bbc two &apos;s newsnight programme he would have advised the labour leader to sing the national anthem &quot; irrespective &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in mr corbyn &apos;s top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
bbc political correspondent robin brant says policy differences are also &quot; stacking up &quot; within labour following mr corbyn &apos;s appointment over its position on the european union and the government &apos;s cap on benefits .
mr corbyn told the tuc conference labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
hours later mr smith , the shadow work and pensions secretary , said the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000 .
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader that david cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became tory leader .
the labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has &quot; crowd sourced &quot; ideas for questions to ask mr cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
the islington north mp has said pmqs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both &quot; repartee &quot; and trading barbs , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
mr corbyn has said that angela eagle , the shadow business secretary , will deputise for him at pmqs when he does not attend - for instance when mr cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the commons speaker john bercow to discuss the issue .
when he became leader in 2005 , mr cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot; punch and judy &quot; style of politics often associated with pmqs but admitted some years later that he had failed .
since it was first televised in 1990 , pmqs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader &apos;s judgement , their command of the commons and their standing among their fellow mps although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound rises as uk wage growth accelerates
the pound jumped following data showing a pick @-@ up in uk wage growth , while the ftse 100 was led higher by bid target sabmiller .
between may and july , uk earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
the rate was the fastest since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
sterling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.5505 and was up 0.84 % against the euro at € 1.3730 .
the ftse 100 index closed up 1.49 % to 6,229.21 .
sabmiller was the stand @-@ out stock on the market , jumping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival ab inbev .
a deal would combine the world &apos;s two largest brewers , bringing together brands such as budweiser , stella artois , peroni and grolsch .
burberry shares were 0.9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group richemont .
richemont &apos;s latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in china - a key market for burberry - had begun to grow again .
shares in glencore rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt @-@ cutting strategy .
shares in packaging and paper group mondi were the biggest fallers on the index , down 4.3 % , after goldman sachs cut its rating on the firm to &quot; sell . &quot;
jd sports rose 3.1 % after the sportswear firm reported an 83 % jump in half @-@ year pre @-@ tax profits to £ 46.6m .
jd sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
jd sports executive chairman peter cowgill says a higher minimum wage for uk workers could mean &quot; more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers . &quot;
but that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm , he says .
the costs could hit jd sports &apos; expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight aldi incursion
metcash is trying to protect its iga stores from an aldi onslaught in south australia and western australia .
grocery wholesaler metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of iga retailers in south australia and western australia ahead of a $ 700 million aldi invasion .
as aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in south australia and western australia early next year , metcash and iga supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the iga brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the adelaide show .
iga retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as dunsborough @-@ based ice cream maker simmo &apos;s offering taste testing at iga stores and store owners selling discounted south australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on september 29 , when the food , liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as south australia and western australia account for almost 30 per cent of metcash &apos;s iga store footprint and generate higher profit margins than metcash &apos;s iga network in the eastern states .
south australian and western australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and iga retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in nsw , victoria and queensland - more than 30 per cent in sa and 24 per cent in wa compared with around 14 per cent in the eastern states .
however , analysts such as morgan stanley believe aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
in a report this week , morgan stanley analyst tom kierath estimated that iga retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that aldi opens 25 stores in sa and 30 in wa next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on metcash &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost metcash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , mr kierath said .
at the same time , metcash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to aldi and coles , even though a recent roy morgan survey found iga shoppers were most loyal .
morgan stanley believes metcash &apos;s food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 .
last week , leading fund manager hamish douglass , the founder of magellan financial group , told a business lunch in melbourne that metcash could &quot; highly , probably disappear within a decade .
metcash has declined to respond publicly to mr douglass &apos; comments .
but it is understood that a metcash board member contacted mr douglass last week .
iga &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from metcash &apos;s food and grocery business , which supplies about 1200 iga retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure .
however , the wholesaler is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching shelf prices at coles and woolworths on hundreds of products each week , helping iga retailers refurbish stores by adding faster @-@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label groceries .
metcash chief executive ian morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017 , for the first time in four years .
thanasi kokkinakis backed by tennis australia president steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
thanasi kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend nick kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to tennis australia president steve healy .
kokkinakis , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the &quot; special ks , &quot; was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous kyrgios sledge of stan wawrinka at the montreal masters .
in a fiery qualifying match in cincinnati soon after , kokkinakis and his opponent ryan harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire , with harrison declaring : &quot; wawrinka should &apos;ve decked kyrgios , and i should deck that kid . &quot;
while he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential us open upset of richard gasquet , kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by healy .
the teenager is currently in glasgow , competing with sam groth for the second singles berth behind bernard tomic in the davis cup semi @-@ final against britain .
&quot; one thing i do feel quite keenly about is i think thanasi &apos;s been dragged into the fray a little bit , &quot; healy said .
he did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the us , but he &apos;s not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself , and i know thanasi well enough to know he wouldn &apos;t be proud of that .
but , really , he &apos;s handled himself extremely well , in pretty provocative circumstances in the us with harrison and so on , and i think he deserves a lot of credit .
he &apos;s a great team around him , he &apos;s got a great family around him and i just think he &apos;s been a little hard done by .
he &apos;s a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he hasn &apos;t ever had an issue with the other players , he &apos;s well respected in the locker room , he trains hard , he &apos;s in great shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy and i just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
healy also backed the decision to overlook kyrgios for the important tie , starting on friday , describing the &quot; mutual decision &quot; as the right thing for all , but backing the canberran to return as a long @-@ term fixture in the team .
&quot; first of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around &#91; kyrgios &#93; , &quot; healy said .
and i think nick , he &apos;s risen very quickly , as people like federer and murray have pointed out , he &apos;s growing up in the public eye and he &apos;s made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we &apos;re trying to support him , we &apos;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that i think is appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
europe migrant crisis : hungary declares emergency , seals border , detains migrants
declaring a state of emergency , hungary sealed off its southern border with serbia on tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in .
chaos ensued at the border , as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man &apos;s land , and serbian officials reacted with outrage .
stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries &apos; checkpoints , those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in .
but frustrations were on the rise .
as a police helicopter hovered above , migrants chanted &quot; open the border ! &quot; and shouted insults at hungarian riot police .
some refused food and water in protest .
serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants were being sent back from hungary while more and more were arriving from macedonia and greece .
( serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
there will have to be talks in the coming days with brussels and other countries , &quot; ivica dacic said in prague .
the turmoil at the hungarian @-@ serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in brussels .
the ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed italy and greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which eu nations would take 120,000 more refugees , including some from hungary .
german chancellor angela merkel and austria called tuesday for a special european union summit next week to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
hungary , however , was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from brussels or its neighbors .
tuesday &apos;s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases .
meanwhile , hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor @-@ wire fence along part of its border with romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the serbian border .
cbs news correspondent charlie d &apos;agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between hungary and serbia .
in the last few months , hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the european union for migrants , many of them war refugees from syria and elsewhere in the middle east .
prime minister viktor orban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other eu nations , including germany .
the new laws that took effect at midnight in hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4 @-@ meter ( 13 @-@ foot ) razor @-@ wire fence the government has built along the southern border with serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the hungarian government declares a state of crisis , &quot; government spokesman zoltan kovacs told reporters in the southern city of szeged .
we are very clear on this : illegal border crossing is a crime .
technically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but associated press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
gyorgy bakondi , homeland security adviser to orban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
they got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws .
authorities are quickly repairing the fence .
hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with serbia on tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them .
chaos enveloped the main border crossing near roszke , hungary , as the hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting serbia and hungary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into hungary .
election 2016 : hillary clinton &apos;s lead over bernie sanders cut by half in national poll
former secretary of state hillary clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination nationally , but sen. bernie sanders is gaining on her .
clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while sanders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
vice president joe biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of democratic primary voters .
more than five months before the start of the primary contests , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
but clinton &apos;s backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
since last month &apos;s cbs news poll , clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups , while sanders has made some gains .
clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates , but those leads have narrowed .
her support among men has dropped considerably and sanders only trails her by 5 points .
clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated , and she and sanders are now even .
however , clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
last month , clinton was ahead of sanders by double @-@ digits among liberals , but sanders now has a 5 @-@ point edge with this group .
about half of democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support clinton if she became the party &apos;s nominee .
a quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
six percent would not support her .
perhaps not surprisingly , clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
views are more mixed among those not currently backing clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her .
while 48 percent of democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back clinton , fewer republican voters say that about their frontrunner , donald trump ( 35 percent ) .
when clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open @-@ ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it &apos;s time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
also mentioned by clinton supporters is her association with bill clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement on the issues , and electability are also cited .
as the vice president weighs a potential run for president , 57 percent of democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don &apos;t think he should .
when democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party &apos;s nomination , biden is the top pick .
among clinton supporters , more than half say biden would be their second choice , far ahead of sanders .
if biden chooses not to run for the democratic nomination , hillary clinton &apos;s lead over sanders widens , from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen .
still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , democratic voters pick issues over electability .
similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
the democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key characteristics among their party &apos;s primary voters .
majorities see clinton , sanders and biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
biden does the best of the three on honesty , while clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of democratic primary voters don &apos;t think clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many as say that about sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t have an opinion of him on this .
democratic primary voters also generally see clinton , sanders and biden as in line with their views ideologically .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of sanders .
as questions continue about hillary clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server while secretary of state , most democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn &apos;t impacted their overall views of her .
but it &apos;s a different story among the american public overall .
half of americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satisfied .
the public &apos;s views on this were split back in march , shortly after the issue came to light .
most americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
it is mainly republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of clinton have become worse .
even though clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party &apos;s voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since may .
sixty @-@ two percent of registered voters don &apos;t think of her as honest and trustworthy .
at the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don &apos;t see trump as honest and trustworthy either .
both clinton and trump , however , get good marks on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , biden , carson and bush do the best on honesty .
more see sanders as honest than not , but like carson , many don &apos;t have an opinion of him .
the margin of error for the sample of 351 democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
ben carson draws close behind donald trump in national poll
ben carson is running close behind donald trump in the newest cbs news / new york times poll
the two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others scrounging for a foothold
republican voters nationwide continue to back trump in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last cbs poll , conducted before the fox news debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out tuesday .
but carson rocketed in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found carson doing well across demographic groups , edging out trump among college @-@ educated republican voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of carly fiorina and ohio gov. john kasich , has slipped behind with wisconsin gov. scott walker falling farthest from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
former florida gov. jeb bush , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee and florida sen. marco rubio all tied for third place with 6 % .
the margin of error for the 376 @-@ person sample of republican voters in this newest poll is plus @-@ or @-@ minus 6 % , and was conducted sept .
the latest cnn / orc survey , released last week , showed carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among republicans , behind trump &apos;s 32 % support .
the latest poll from abc news / washington post also showed trump significantly ahead of carson .
facing a rising carson last week , trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon , even as carson apologized for questioning trump &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; trump said last saturday during a campaign stop in iowa .
five fraternity members charged in death of baruch college freshman
nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in pennsylvania &apos;s pocono mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
members of new york city &apos;s baruch college pi delta psi fraternity brutally assaulted chun &quot; michael &quot; deng during an initiation rite in september 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
officials said he was blindfolded , saddled with a 30 @-@ pound backpack full of sand , and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field .
mr. deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious .
pi delta psi fraternity members did not call 911 after deng passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
they did , however , find time to change deng &apos;s clothes , google his symptoms , and contact andy meng , the fraternity &apos;s national president to seek advice , police chief chris wagner said at a news conference .
&quot; at this point , members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity &apos;s well @-@ being over that of michael deng &apos;s , &quot; chief wagner said .
he could not be revived and he died the next morning .
according to an autopsy report , deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head , torso , and thighs .
&quot; too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing , with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970 , &quot; douglas fierberg , an attorney representing deng &apos;s family , said in a statement .
fraternities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
a monroe county grand jury recommended third @-@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two other fraternity members , including mr. meng , will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy .
&quot; we want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there &apos;s an organization that sanctioned it , whether officially or unofficially , we &apos;re going to hold them accountable as well , &quot; wagner said at a news conference tuesday .
baruch college banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter .
here &apos;s what will happen when the fed raises interest rates
a rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
this we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
for the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
a recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
the federal reserve &apos;s aggressiveness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
that &apos;s why officials at the u.s. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize .
there are , indeed , multiple variables at play .
in the end , however , market participants may find that all the rate @-@ hike fuss may have been overdone .
&quot; the first hike from the fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of &apos; cheap money , &apos; &quot; julian jessop , chief global economist at capital economics , said in a note to clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of u.s. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
that &apos;s not to say there won &apos;t be effects , however .
here &apos;s a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
as the market has seen over the past month or so , anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while .
once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
&quot; it does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12 @-@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy , &quot; deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the fed hikes .
more specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent , according to a recent analysis bob doll , chief equity strategist at nuveen asset management , posted on barron &apos;s .
deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate @-@ hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often help them along .
in the current case , the fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession .
most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a fed rate hike .
according to deutsche bank , in the 118 rate hikes since 1950 , only twice has nominal year over year gdp been below 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the atlanta fed .
hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; deutsche said .
market participants have been bracing for a fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week &apos;s federal open market committee meeting , which ends thursday .
while many strategists and economists believe the fomc could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study since 1950 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with gdp eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing , &quot; the report said .
by contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
the current cycle is by far the longest the fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience .
the principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the fed changes course in policy .
for bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
at the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately , &quot; deutsche said .
charles schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter @-@ dated bonds to move closer together , flattening the curve .
high @-@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though &quot; we are still cautious about stretching for yield , &quot; kathy jones , fixed income analyst at schwab , said in an analysis .
interestingly , jones thinks markets already have adapted to fed policy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates are up , the yield curve is flatter , credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the fed tightens policy .
broadly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the u.s. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
&quot; history shows that &apos; quality &apos; stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike , &quot; goldman sachs analysts said in a report for clients .
firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hikes , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
debt will become a big issue .
companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most , goldman said .
outside pure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
bbc radio 3 is a copy of classic fm says mp andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticised station for &apos; dumbing down&apos;
argues it &apos;s becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
also took aim at the bbc music awards , saying they just rip off the brits
colleague damien collins mp attacked the voice , saying that too wasn &apos;t original
bbc radio 3 is &quot; turning into &quot; classic fm , a leading mp has claimed , piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not .
conservative mp andrew bingham also told bbc bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be &quot; dumbing down &quot; and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival .
&quot; radio 3 seems to be - i don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dumbing down &quot; - but it seems to be turning into classic fm , &quot; he said .
he also took aim at the bbc music awards , launched last december .
the bbc music awards which started last year seem to be the brits by another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you &apos;re actually just mimicking what is already on the market , &quot; mr bingham said .
bbc director general denied the charges , arguing that bbc radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public .
what i learn from radio 3 , i am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else .
and it &apos;s commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
&quot; and also , radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works i think is also really important , &quot; he said .
earlier this year , bbc radio 3 controller alan davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because britons are less educated about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the bbc &apos;s output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals , during the culture , media and sport select committee hearing .
tory mp damien collins attacked the voice - the musical talent show which the bbc bought in from dutch producer talpa media at an estimated cost of £ 22million .
can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show - which stars paloma faith and boy george as judges - was produced &quot; in a particularly bbc way . &quot;
he added that he wants the corporation to &quot; find a hit from our own in @-@ house stable &quot; next time it launches an entertainment series .
however , he refused to rule out ordering more series of the voice in the future , or spending licence fee payers &apos; money on other entertainment formats .
internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in august and black friday may be to blame
first three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
experts believe november &apos;s black friday could be holding back spending
for over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of britain &apos;s high streets into ghost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for august presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
&apos;if you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to rationalise over time , &apos; andy mulcahy , editor of imrg sales index , told the guardian .
he explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
it meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts , such as on the sofa .
but now that is plateauing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
the black friday phenomenon , which has been imported from america , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last friday in november .
last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites .
experts believe black friday , which saw shoppers fight over bargains , could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
research published by the british retail consortium found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
for some products , such as tvs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
muslims bury those killed in mecca crane crash as bin laden family sanctioned
bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by muslims as the first funerals take place in mecca
come as saudi arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant saudi binladin group
the health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
carried aloft through the streets , hundreds of muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at mecca &apos;s grand mosque .
dressed largely in white , mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to al @-@ moaissem cemetery .
the sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers .
the bodies were released for funeral as the saudi king sanctioned the bin laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 394 injured .
the bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at mecca &apos;s grand central mosque were carried through the streets
among the dead was father @-@ of @-@ four qasim akram , from bolton , greater manchester , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down .
mr akram had been in the grand mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage .
saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city .
today , king salman said the binladin group should not have left the crane &apos;s arm up when it was not in use .
an arabic version of the decree , carried by the state @-@ run saudi press agency , said the binladin group was partly to blame for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s english service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad .
earlier this week salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month .
binladin group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
the royal decree also blamed the group for not using up @-@ to @-@ date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials .
dozens of cranes surround mecca &apos;s grand mosque , part of the massive construction effort headed by the binladin group .
the binladin family has been close to saudi arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
al qaida &apos;s late leader osama bin laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s .
the crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every able @-@ bodied muslim .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
officials ordered one million riyals ( £ 174,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those permanently injured .
others injured will receive half that amount .
b &amp; q boss says eastern european tradesmen working cheap is behind trend
britons are increasingly employing handymen says veronique laury
number of skilled tradesmen from eastern europe behind rise
resulting in 200 more screwfix stores , aimed at tradesmen , opening
at same time kingfisher is closing 60 b &amp; q outlets across the country
by rupert steiner , chief city correspondent for the daily mail
britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled eastern european tradesmen to carry out work in their home
if you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
because britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out diy jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind b &amp; q .
veronique laury , new chief executive of kingfisher , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from eastern europe offering services at rock @-@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
as a result , kingfisher is planning to open 200 more screwfix stores , which are aimed at tradesmen , while closing 60 b &amp; q outlets .
mrs laury said she wants more women to be employed in b &amp; q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex .
currently the majority of staff are men .
she said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
mrs laury said : &quot; we still have a majority of men working in our stores .
we need to move more towards a balance .
fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
women play a big part in the decision @-@ making process .
mrs laury , who is one of only five women at the helm of britain &apos;s ftse100 index of leading firms , has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors .
kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
mrs laury said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
kingfisher posted a fall in both half @-@ year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores .
as a result of the trend kingfisher , which owns screwfix and b &amp; q , is opening 200 new stores
decision time on interest rates for us federal reserve
the world is watching as the us federal reserve meets over two days on wednesday and thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
a survey of 80 economists polled by reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0 @-@ 0.25 percent range .
it &apos;s a historical event because it &apos;s been seven years since the fed cut rates to zero .
for the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates , &quot; said angel ubide , senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics .
the us economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
however the fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook .
it has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
the decision is due to be announced at 20.00 cet on thursday .
delta state university shooter left note of apology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in mississippi on monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - shannon lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; for the first murder and wished he &quot; could take it back , &quot; authorities revealed tuesday .
police in gautier , miss. said lamb , a geography and social science education instructor at delta state university , called 911 around 10 a.m .
monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
he said &quot; i shot my wife last night &quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house that is &quot; not going to bother anyone &quot; but is likely upset .
police asked the caller his name , but he didn &apos;t give it .
lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
when police got to the scene they found the body of amy prentiss , 41 , and a handwritten note from lamb , 45 , that said : &quot; i am so sorry i wish i could take it back .
i loved amy and she is the only person who ever loved me .
after writing the note , lamb drove 300 miles to delta state where he killed ethan schmidt , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late monday as cops closed in .
university president william laforge said he didn &apos;t know of any conflict between lamb and schmidt but &quot; obviously there was something in mr. lamb &apos;s mind . &quot;
despite reports monday that lamb allegedly believed prentiss was also romantically involved with schmidt , authorities said tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; love triangle . &quot;
prentiss was described as a &quot; good person &quot; by shawn o &apos;steen , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
the two divorced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;steen said he and prentiss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; devastated . &quot;
he said prentiss and her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
prentiss worked an online job from her home , according to linsday knowles , identified as a close friend of prentiss by the sun herald .
knowles said prentiss , who had a hound dog named lightning , had been dating lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; knowles said .
police said lamb had phoned relatives at some point monday to tell them &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
when cops caught up with him on highway 1 near greenville later that night , lamb pulled his car over , bailed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
lamb received a doctorate in education from delta state in the spring of 2015 , according to his resume posted on the university &apos;s website .

manchester united &apos;s luke shaw out for months with double fracture
luke shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during manchester united &apos;s champions league defeat at psv eindhoven .
while this left the full @-@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , louis van gaal remains hopeful shaw could play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reckless tackle from héctor moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old shaw had burst into the psv area .
he had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van gaal said : &quot; he has a double leg fracture and is in hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in manchester .
it is awful - a boy who comes to manchester united at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens .
when it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on .
he was crying .
i am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
i hope he can play again this season .
moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot @-@ kick .
nicola rizzoli , the referee , did not penalise the mexican .
van gaal suggested the italian official had erred .
you can judge for yourself when i say it is a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad tackle with two legs .
a tweet on shaw &apos;s account read : &quot; thank you everyone for your messages , words can &apos;t describe how gutted i am , my road to recovery starts now , i will come back stronger . &quot;

the england defender will have an added incentive to recover with the european championship in france next june .
phillip cocu , the psv coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent .
moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for mexico against van gaal &apos;s holland at the 2014 world cup .
&quot; he finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; cocu said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing i could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; moreno &#93; touched it , but i couldn &apos;t see the tackle on luke .
speaking to sbs6 , moreno said : &quot; i know how it feels , i know how difficult such a thing can be .
i feel very bad about it , i am so sorry .
psv &apos;s andrés guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by chris smalling .
surely david cameron knows the lorax better than this ?
it &apos;s one thing any parent soon learns : when your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost by heart .
unless , it seems , you are david cameron .
asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids &apos; book , the prime minister opted for the lorax , the 1971 environmental fable by dr seuss .
it was a difficult choice , cameron writes in a message published on the website of the supercamps company , continuing : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s one i enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
all very well , except that the subsequent paragraph in which cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text .
&quot; set in the walled city of thneed @-@ ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey , by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree , &quot; it reads , chronicling a love interest unknown to dr seuss , real name theodor seuss geisel , who died in 1991 .
if that wasn &apos;t suspicious enough , cameron &apos;s submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the lorax film provided on the internet movie database website , which begins : &quot; in the walled city of thneed @-@ ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , audrey . &quot;
given he is an avowedly hands @-@ on parent , it seems unlikely cameron is so unfamiliar with the book &apos;s plot , in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious , tree @-@ chopping , thneed @-@ knitting once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the eponymous lorax , a squat , moustachioed creature who &quot; speaks for the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively lowly pr task would have been outsourced to an aide , seemingly one who has never read the lorax 20 times in a row to a child .
a downing street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from cameron &apos;s constituency office .
supercamps confirmed that the text was provided from cameron &apos;s staff , but had no further immediate comment .
adam lyth was clearly at risk of england omission but it &apos;s still tough
taking on pakistan in the united arab emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad england have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
i wouldn &apos;t rule out an away win , either .
alastair cook &apos;s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a youthful positivity .
with the ball , moeen ali is developing as a spinner and adil rashid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test level , represents an attacking option .
related : adam lyth dropped from england test squad and replaced by alex hales
the decision to omit adam lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at yorkshire .
his seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output .
there were no question marks over joe root , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and i have said this before - players are their own best selectors .
a couple of half @-@ centuries and lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny .
hopefully if he punches out more runs for yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
the england head coach , trevor bayliss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
the question of how long a test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one .
lyth got seven caps - like sam robson before him - while nick compton got nine .
only compton got the chance home and away .
the only gripe you could have was that england went for jonathan trott in the caribbean first - when lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now .
alex hales comes in and he is a batsman i rate highly .
he is an x @-@ factor cricketer , which we at yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a trent bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
he must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make @-@ up of the side in the uae .
the idea of moeen opening the batting alongside cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks , has been floated and it is not something i am against .
i don &apos;t see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left @-@ hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer .
moeen may not have done the job for his county , worcestershire , but he has been a no3 for them and there is not much difference .
my old team @-@ mate justin langer played his first 38 tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
he peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
zafar ansari comes into the squad as back @-@ up spinner and , in my limited dealings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
people may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
away from the squad , england look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff .
the appointment of mahela jayawardene , the sri lanka batsman , as a consultant for the test matches could be a masterstroke .
he is one of the game &apos;s loveliest blokes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
paul collingwood comes in for the white @-@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup .
i always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket , be it playing or coaching , and like mahela has nous that can be tapped .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can freshen up a side .
colly &apos;s durham team @-@ mate ben stokes is rested for the one @-@ dayers , root was given a similar break against australia and i for one have no issue with this .
while not everyone will agree , the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule .
and you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
such decisions are never taken lightly .
brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
david cameron &apos;s half @-@ baked renegotiation strategy for keeping britain in the eu gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of genial jeremy &quot; is it yes or no ? &quot; corbyn to the labour leadership , or the tuc cutting up rough over europe on tuesday .
foreigners have their corbyns and nigel farages too .
a european diplomat chum explained the other day that , sunk in assorted crises as the eu is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with britain &apos;s self @-@ absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in brighton for its annual bean , the tuc decided it didn &apos;t want them either if they eroded social protection .
we could even call it dave and george &apos;s selfie agenda .
pm and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local grandee , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
it &apos;s all about me .
my european pal , who wants an outward @-@ looking britain inside the eu tent - &quot; don &apos;t leave us alone with france , &quot; says berlin - suggests that more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or leave .
angela merkel , germany &apos;s cautiously level @-@ headed chancellor , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for overstayers thatcher ( 11 years ) , mitterrand ( 14 ) and kohl ( 16 ) .
france &apos;s françois hollande is facing re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is a fading force too .
poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right , spain one of the left .
it &apos;s hard to see them breaking a leg to help the selfie brits , whose energy might be better spent preventing scotland leaving the uk - something they don &apos;t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
so some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks , snp @-@ style , during the uk &apos;s 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the brexit process , my pal suggests .
&quot; the renegotiation was a fix &quot; and &quot; britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation . &quot;
the europeans know to their cost how predatory fleet street can be and how eu @-@ sceptic the oligarch press barons are , as they were not during the tony benn @-@ inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may dimly remember boris johnson , the arch euro @-@ opportunist , making his name as an &quot; eu straight bananas &quot; brussels correspondent in the early 90s .
for all his foolishness ed miliband knew who his enemies were .
they included the medley of tax @-@ shy rascals , phone @-@ hacking foreigners and pseudo non @-@ doms who own most of our great newspapers .
actually tony blair thought much the same about them , but realised that when you &apos;re in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
in fact miliband was more blairite than blair in opposing cameron &apos;s referendum wheeze , since blair had conceded the principle over the eu &apos;s aborted constitution , sunk by french and dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get @-@ out card .
the press never forgave him that either .
but nice jeremy corbyn , who gave me a friendly pat on the back at westminster on monday - i told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re @-@ adopting neil kinnock &apos;s boycott murdoch strategy of the 80s , a mistake then and now .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with andrew marr whose bbc sofa he vacated on sunday .
corbyn &apos;s official position on europe is what i will kindly call evolving .
he says he &apos;d like us to stay in a reformed eu .
well , most people outside ukip &apos;s woad @-@ wearing tendency and the wilder shores of tory little englanderism can probably say yes to that .
it &apos;s what hilary &quot; a benn , but not a bennite &quot; benn said on radio and tv this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that corbyn &apos;s appointment of abrasive john mcdonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70s , when his old dad struggled on tv to be disloyal to labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
hilary &apos;s struggle was more attractive .
but fighting to stay in &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - benn &apos;s phrase - was not what mcdonnell was saying , nor what jc told peers and mps at their private meeting on monday night , by all accounts .
whatever the bottom @-@ up , touchy @-@ feely image corbyn wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 tv and especially in the maelstrom that is social media , a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal .
it &apos;s fair enough not to give cameron a free pass on europe , allowing him to take labour &apos;s support for granted in the referendum campaign , as mcdonnell has said .
simon jenkins certainly thinks so .
but mcdonnell and corbyn &apos;s basic equivocation about eu membership - consistent with their bennite siege economy , anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles .
as with his equivocation over nato - tom watson is adamant that jc won &apos;t campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
why should paris or berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to britain when it may all be pointless ?
the us is already pretty disappointed with the brits &quot; feeble military performance in iraq , libya and syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting tory government in power , as i was reminded at the launch of something called the british influence security forum on monday .
experts criticise public health england e @-@ cigarettes review
claims by a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
experts writing in the british medical journal ( bmj ) joined the lancet in criticising the evidence used by public health england ( phe ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
phe published the &quot; landmark &quot; report last month , describing it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the lancet medical journal last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily flimsy foundation &quot; on which phe based its main conclusion .
writing in the bmj , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were &quot; built on rock or sand . &quot;
martin mckee , professor of european public health at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , and simon capewell , professor of clinical epidemiology at the university of liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public would expect phe &apos;s claims that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( mcda ) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper .
mckee and capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from british american tobacco for an independent study .
he also endorsed bat &apos;s public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company philip morris international , they added .
the rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e @-@ cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at phe .
the research paper produced by the group &quot; tellingly concedes &quot; there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria , &quot; mckee and capewell wrote .
however , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the phe report .
mckee and capewell said phe &apos;s claims that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
prof kevin fenton , director of health and wellbeing at phe , said the claims in the bmj had been responded to before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot;
one in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction .
all of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e @-@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
phe has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking @-@ related illness and smoking costs the nhs £ 2bn a year .
by spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e @-@ cigarettes are not risk @-@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit .
bbc should give up eastenders , says former channel 4 chief
the former channel 4 chairman luke johnson has said the bbc should stop broadcasting programmes such as eastenders and the voice , saying its commercial rivals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the albert square soap .
johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other uk broadcasters .
he criticised the bbc for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals &quot; biggest rating shows , and on channels such as bbc4 .
after the bbc &apos;s director general , tony hall , said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at channel 4 to do a tie @-@ up with the bbc without success .
&quot; i do struggle with the idea that the bbc commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals , &quot; johnson told the house of lords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the bbc .
if you keep the licence fee , which i &apos;m not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren &apos;t making and commissioning .
they broadcast the voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
the idea that no one else would show that is a joke , it &apos;s ludicrous , it &apos;s obviously nonsense .
johnson said : &quot; i don &apos;t see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy .
the voice is one , eastenders is another , admittedly made in @-@ house .
frankly other channels would give their right arm for it .
i struggle to see how it &apos;s public service broadcasting .
i don &apos;t think that would diminish the bbc at all .
johnson , a serial entrepreneur who led channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the bbc was guilty of chasing ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the bbc &apos;s most popular shows echo those of former sky executive tony ball , who used his mactaggart lecture in edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the bbc sell off shows such as eastenders .
johnson said the bbc &apos;s more niche public service programmes &quot; go on to bbc4 where quite often you can &apos;t measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £ 4bn in licence fee income , &quot; well of course , we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched . &quot;
they put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
on the licence fee , johnson told the committee : &quot; i challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money i wonder if they do because they don &apos;t consume a lot of the bbc .
former sky and channel 5 executive david elstein , who also gave evidence to the committee on tuesday , said the bbc should revise its reithian mission to &quot; inform , educate and entertain . &quot;
he said little of the bbc &apos;s output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its tv output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in australia and canada and change it to &quot; inform , enlighten and entertain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , elstein said the bbc should do more in areas such as the proms , of which he said only a handful were shown on tv , and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online .
&apos;sonogenetics &apos; allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
the video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
the tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high @-@ pitched for humans to hear .
the pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves .
related : researchers read and write brain activity with light
researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed sonogenetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells from outside the body .
sreekanth chalasani , a researcher at the salk institute in la jolla , california , told the guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people &apos;s brains to treat symptoms of parkinson &apos;s disease .
nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found , amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms .
the amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called trp @-@ 4 ion channels , found in the membranes of some of the worms &quot; cells .
the sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in nature communications .
to make ultrasound @-@ controlled nematodes , chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried trp @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms , where they switched on the modified motor neurons .
the procedure has some similarities with optogenetics , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light .
but chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
&quot; we believe that , using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus , it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said chalasani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .
illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep !
the adverts shaming britain &apos;s arms trade
watch amnesty international &apos;s anti @-@ arms fair video .
horrific killer drones !
ankle @-@ shattering leg irons !
cluster bombs !
and electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace !
the cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world &apos;s biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof , produced for amnesty international to highlight the british government &apos;s willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the defence and security equipment international &apos;s jamboree at the excel centre in london &apos;s docklands .

but a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance .
&quot; important announcement , travelling on the dlr from 15th to 18th september ? &quot; reads one , using london underground fonts and branding with the dlr line turning into the image of a tank .
this september , a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the dlr ... customers are requested to help stop the arms fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the museum of cruel designs in banksy &apos;s dismaland .
a collective called the special patrol group helped distribute it around london using &quot; ad space hack packs , &quot; a £ 6 pack of allen keys which it claims &quot; gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet . &quot;
transport for london is not amused by this flyposting &quot; vandalism . &quot;
one of the spoof ads produced by the special patrol group collective .
according to gavin grindon , curator of cruel designs and a lecturer at the university of essex , artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries .
a lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements , realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube .
the amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via facebook and was created by ad agency vccp working pro bono , with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free .
vccp creative director matt lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on excel &apos;s calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . &quot;
they toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert , but &quot; by ramming it home with bright colours and animation , it was more arresting . &quot;
&quot; they &apos;ve done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says tom davies at amnesty .
what we need now is for the uk government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep .
perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside excel , where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products .
in a press release , saab revealed an order from the us army for &quot; the shoulder @-@ launched at4cs rs . &quot;
this includes a &quot; unique shaped @-@ charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind @-@ armour @-@ effects inside the target . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student halls
it &apos;s been 11 years since i moved into student halls as an oblivious 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in berets and moral relativism , but it &apos;s only now i recall the strained smiles of those i annoyed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what i learned can be distilled into eight simple rules .
moving into halls can range from mildly nerve @-@ racking to totally terrifying .
it &apos;s tempting to babble : telling people where you &apos;re from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on corbyn and why you &quot; honestly neither love nor hate marmite because seriously guys it &apos;s just yeast extract hahaha i &apos;ll be in my room . &quot;
take a breath .
and help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
it steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn &apos;t talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers .
give people space .
people &apos;s rooms often morph into drinks receptions , movie @-@ night venues and communal hangout spots , but they &apos;re also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear .
related : don &apos;t even think about starting university in a relationship
introverts get a raw deal at university .
your room should be a retreat , yet many halls form an inter @-@ room @-@ strolling culture that &apos;s friendly , social and conducive to lifelong friendships .
that can be hell for someone who &apos;s trying to recharge .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; i like you and i want our friendship to continue , but i need you to go away so i can get back the energy i &apos;ve expended on interacting with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking .
speaking of knocking : do it .
one guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn &apos;t locked he was invited in .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
since you &apos;re starting uni at the height of bake @-@ off mania , knocking on people &apos;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird , less 1950s &quot; welcome to the neighbourhood , i baked you something , now smile as i ask you personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends .
your housemates will feel obliged to chat , and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise .
obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker .
poorly @-@ fused lumps of flour , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock .
stealing food is a common crime in student halls .
obviously nicking someones chicken is theft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing ?
double check with the milk owner .
chances are they &apos;ll tell you to help yourself even if they &apos;re seething inside .
if someone steals your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate , who tainted her milk with washing @-@ up liquid to punish those who stole it .
she &apos;s in jail now .
you shouldn &apos;t make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
this isn &apos;t just to be a decent human , but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn &apos;t mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded by turning it up .
when they finally shut up at 5am , she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music , locking her door as she left for her three @-@ hour exam .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?

oil companies officially collapsed
an investment of 400 billion dollars was shelved and most deep @-@ sea oil exploration projects were suspended between 2014 , when oil prices started to drop , and the end of last year .
according to research from the consulting company wood mackenzie , low oil prices were the cause of the suspension of the 380 billion dollar @-@ project for oil and gas exploration / production , and the production of millions of barrels of oil was postponed in a vast area reaching from the mexican gulf to africa .
the report showing that the biggest reason for the price drop is that oil prices have fallen from their 2014 level of 115 dollars to their lowest level in the last 12 years , losing more than 70 percent of their value in 1.5 years , includes the statement that &quot; company budgets have dramatically shrunk . &quot;
400 billion dollars on hold
while the crude oil price continues to surprise every single day , it has recently fallen under the 30 dollar mark , which is its lowest level in the last 12 years .
in these days of heated debates about &quot; whether the price of oil can fall below 15 dollars , &quot; or &quot; whether oil is dirt cheap , &quot; the research published by the energy consulting firm wood mackenzie reveals how the sector has been affected by the falling prices .
suggesting that the falling oil prices caused the suspension of 46 big energy investments worth 200 billion dollars in a report published in july , wood mackenzie , in new research , disclosed what the total figure was up to the end of 2015 .
according to this , while 22 more projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015 , a total of 68 projects were suspended from 2014 , when the drop in oil prices began .
the value of these projects is estimated at around 400 billion dollars .
2.9 million barrels per day
in the research , it has been underlined that the low oil prices had a &quot; brutal &quot; effect on company plans and it has been noted that the projects most affected were deep water development projects .
the suspended projects correspond to a total reserve of 27 billion barrels of crude oil , and the daily production of 2.9 million barrels has therefore been delayed until 2025 .
according to the research , the final investment decision for most of the aforementioned projects was later shelved until 2017 , and the first production goals are targeting the years between 2020 and 2023 .
the report underlines that the postponed 68 projects include a potential 170 billion dollar investment that is predicted to be carried out in the next 5 years , and &quot; most of the 170 billion dollars is comprised of deep water projects . &quot;
the reason for this is the high preliminary investment costs .
it is said that &quot; 70 percent of the deep @-@ sea expenditure is made up in particular of oil based projects in nigeria , angola and the mexican gulf in the u.s. &quot;
according to the research , the countries having the biggest number of suspended projects are canada , angola , kazakhstan , nigeria , norway and the u.s .
these six countries have almost 90 percent of the suspended liquid ( oil ) reserves .
mozambique , australia , malaysia and indonesia account for the biggest number of suspended gas reserves with 85 percent of the total .
most of the natural gas waiting to be extracted lies in deep waters , and requires complex and expensive solutions such as building a liquefied natural gas ( lng ) plant from scratch .
it has been stated that the most endangered companies are the oil giants having successive undertakings in the canadian oil sands and the caspian sea region , and it is said that these companies are trying to adapt to the scenario of &quot; lower for longer &quot; oil prices .
eyes on iran
just four years ago the situation was as follows : the u.s. and europe imposed an embargo on iran oil to stop tehran &apos;s nuclear program ; the barrel price of oil was around 110 dollars and debate centred on how iran &apos;s oil exports would be cut without causing any sharp jump in the prices .
when we return to this week , we witness a very different scenario .
oil prices have fallen below 30 dollars for the first time since 2004 , and the principal cause of this was the production boom in the u.s. ; and embargoes imposed on iran being abolished .
for this reason , all the eyes are on iran .
if iran increases its oil exports , more oil will be added to the market , which is said to be already quite full .
this may cause the price to fall below even the surprising levels of today .
some analysts are saying that saudi arabia , not wanting to lose any market share to iran , will pump more oil and iran and s. arabia will enter a price war .
soon after the elimination of the enforcements , it is stated that the principal targets of iran are india , being the fastest growing oil market in asia , and its old partners in europe .
iranian officials have previously said that they aimed to increase initial exports by 500 thousand barrels a day and to add the same amount to the market after a while .
according to the map data from reuters , there are 22 very large crude carriers ( vlcc ) waiting off the coast of iran , 13 of which are fully or mostly loaded .
iran is in the position of being the country with the fourth biggest proven oil reserves in the world .
thanks to exceptions within the embargo , iran currently exports approximately 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries including turkey .
before the embargo , iran &apos;s daily oil export increased to 3 million barrels a day .
a research specialist at securities company destek menkul değerler , aysun göksu , answers the question of whether oil will fall below 20 dollars as follows : &quot; china @-@ centred global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices and intensifies the drop in oil prices . &quot;
we are seeing that losses reached 20 percent since the beginning of the year amid concerns that the demand for oil would decline in line with the economic slowdown in china , which is the biggest oil importer in the world .
in addition to this , we may witness oil prices below 30 dollars in the forthcoming days due to the effects of the global appreciation of the dollar and the problem of global excess supply .
as long as we do not see any permanent pricing above the 32 @-@ 33 dollar @-@ level , the upward movement of oil prices may remain limited and the downward pressure on prices may increase .
at that point , we can say that closing prices under the 30 dollar @-@ level will play a key role in the continuation of the decline .
in this situation , it should be no surprise if it is seen that there is a loosening of the support level of 23.30 @-@ 25.60 in the lower end .
isham sardouk : &quot; the era of angels is now over ! &quot;
while carrying out the duty of trend creation in wgsn , which determines the fashion trends of victoria &apos;s secret and the world ; why did you change your course to turkey ?
- i am always pro @-@ change .
i was born in paris , lived in london , and after that went to new york .
i took up key positions there .
meanwhile , i started to provide consultancy services to koton over the last two years .
after that i saw the potential in this area and the brand koton .
i realized that everything needed to be a worldwide chain store was there .
now i &apos;m here to make it happen .
can you achieve this in a short time ?
- sure .
even though it is a small brand , it is already sold in 50 countries .
we launch 50 collections every year , we have 15 different sections .
in other words , there is everything a chain store needs to have .
we can respond to the needs of the consumers in different areas from dubai to moscow .
currently , we are opening a store in paris in may , and it is the beginning of a new and exciting era ...
is it a must to open a store in paris ?
- yes .
it is not because the economic situation in europe is great .
however , you open some stores for image .
you have stores in fashion capitals such as paris , london and you make money in the middle east .
one of them adds prestige to the brand and the other adds money ; both of them are necessary for a brand making an effort to be global .
ok , so let &apos;s talk about the trends ...
- we have a romantic and chic season ahead of us .
flying chiffon dresses , smooth tones , pinks , whites , reds .
designs ...
we are experiencing harsh and brutal times ; the fashion world always brings chic and heart @-@ warming designs to the podium and tries to add a tiny bit of happiness to life in times like this .
what we are doing is the same .
for this reason , the &quot; era of elegance &quot; is returning in the new season .
let &apos;s go back to your years in victoria &apos;s secret .
who was the most legendary angel ? - karolina kurkova .
i am not talking about her gorgeous physique : she is so positive and she is such a good girl !
while working , she sat beside me and said &quot; are you hungry , honey ? &quot; and gave me an apple , etc .
in a word , she was so sweet .
you also know what i am talking about , i looked into you and discovered that you have done lots of interviews with all the models of victoria &apos;s secret .
karolina is so beautiful , isn &apos;t she ?
but adriana lima also impressed me with her beauty ...
- you have a point , but that voice !
her voice , her intonation ...
it stresses you after a while and you say , &quot; sit somewhere and look beautiful ; do nothing else ! &quot;
it can irritate .
yes , you can experience these kinds of shocks .
i done an interview with candice swanepoel .
she was the most beautiful girl i &apos;ve ever seen in my life but i was astonished by her empty @-@ headedness .
- most of them are like that .
the new angels are not like in the past ...
i remember the time of gisele ...
it was quite hard to work with her though .
she used to come backstage and smoke like a chimney .
it was not because she is addicted .
nobody can smoke you see , only she can smoke !
it is just to be a &quot; diva . &quot;
broadcast two months ago , the victoria &apos;s secret fashion parade got the lowest rating in its history .
why do you think that is ?
- as i said , that legendary era of beautiful angels is now over .
pardon me , who needs gigi hadid ?
what is beautiful about her ?
kendall jenner , for example , she is as flat as a board ...
there are no curves , there is nothing .
kate moss is not curvy either but she became the biggest name in the fashion industry .
- it is true but her face was so beautiful .
i want to use my right to object .
last year , i did an interview with her ; her face has gotten quite old ...
- between smoking and alcohol , she naturally lost her beauty .
but she had such a beautiful face in the nineties .
her lips were like brigitte bardot &apos;s .
she represents the end of the supermodel era .
the era of linda evangelista , naomi campbell and christy turlington ...
christy was my next door @-@ neighbour and i saw her without makeup .
there cannot be such pure beauty , there cannot be such elegance .
what about cara delevingne ?
- she &apos;s wasting herself .
there is no need to be involved in every campaign .
people get bored .
besides , there is no hunger for &quot; famous models and celebrities &quot; like in the past .
people want to see real faces like their own faces in the campaigns .
we will go towards this .
because the trend is this .

part @-@ time work rights for mothers causes debate
türk @-@ i̇ş says &quot; we think that part @-@ time rights have been given to mothers to bring in labour for hire . &quot;
&quot; it may be a trojan horse , &quot; and ti̇sk claimed &quot; we are worried about whether this regulation on behalf of women will prevent women from work or not . &quot;
new rights planned for civil servants and working women after giving birth or adoption were passed by the committee after day long negotiations .
&quot; labour for hire &quot; became the main topic in the committee negotiations of the regulations , which will bring the right of part @-@ time work or unpaid leave to 6 months after giving birth and part @-@ time work up until primary school age for the child .
while stating that it is proper to recruit on a part @-@ time basis until the child starts primary school they still have worries , a chp deputy of izmir musa çam added , &quot; if you bring the labour for hire regulation , we will stand against it to the bitter end . &quot;
taking part in the negotions on behalf of türk @-@ i̇ş and saying they have the same worries , enis bağdadioğlu stated , &quot; we have doubts about how the places for part @-@ time working women will be filled . &quot;
adding that if labour for hire is added to the agenda again on this occasion there will be matters much more problematic than sub @-@ contracted labour , bağdadioğlu said , &quot; we will watch the developments related to private employment agencies with much concern . &quot;
the general secretary of ti̇sk , bülent pirler stated that part @-@ time work for a period of 5 years came about with this law , and he added , &quot; there is no part @-@ time work for such a long period in other countries . &quot;
also look at the matter this way .
&quot; it is necessary to think about the consequences of this implementation in places having 1 or 2 employees . &quot;
tobb advisor ahmet şağar also said that there will be problems finding workers if the regulation is implemented .
adding that there is no legislation related to the rules to be implemented on part @-@ time work , şağar stated , &quot; employers and employees should come to an agreement until regulations related to private employment agencies have been made . &quot;
metin feyzioğlu : we don &apos;t support it
the statement from feyzioğlu is as follows : &quot; we don &apos;t stand by this declaration ; it is not possible for us to stand by and support it . &quot;
because there isn &apos;t one sentence of criticism against the pkk .
you couldn &apos;t say anything unfavourable , even one sentence against this separatist terror organization , the pkk ; they are considered above blame .
they are only harsh expressions to the state ; we don &apos;t take those who used them seriously or find them sincere .
we are legal experts , we are lawyers .
if there is any illegal behaviour from representatives of the state , public officials and security forces in this context , let us go after it .
when we say &quot; don &apos;t demolish the state &quot; to the separatists or the relics of the period of truce who sympathise and romanticise the separatists , they attack by calling us &quot; separatist , fascist . &quot;
when we say , &quot; this state should behave in accordance with the law and should always value the law most , &quot; they say , &quot; you are acting as a separatist &quot; to us .
we are a bridge .
we are the people who are obliged to always tell the truth .

they will be deported with bicycles
however , the refugees , most of whom are syrians , will have to return to russia by pedalling in minus 20 degrees because the two countries could not reach an agreement .
a group of refugees went to russia by plane , travelled to the north of the country and went to norway from murmansk because it is safer and cheaper during the summer months .
as the agreement between the two countries does not allow crossing of the border on foot , the refugees crossed the border by bicycle .
norway has now decided to return these refugees .
for this reason , the norway police ordered the repair of the bicycles that were abandoned after crossing the border .
&quot; 3 billion euros to turkey &quot; crisis in eu
the crisis is continuing with 3 billion euros pledged to turkey for the refugees .
the president of the european commission , jean claude juncker , criticised the prime minister of italy , matteo renzi &apos;s blocking of the funds to be transferred to turkey .
stating that the mood between italy and the rest of europe is not good , juncker underlined that the eu has to find the 3 billion euros .
juncker said &quot; this money is not for turkey , but for syrian refugees in turkey . &quot;
we have not yet reached 3 billion .
&quot; this is an issue related to the credibility of the eu and is therefore very important , &quot; he said .
juncker stated that he expected the money to be completed by january 26 , which was the deadline given .
italy is one of the countries drawing attention for their positive attitudes when it comes to turkey .
diplomatic sources say that rome &apos;s stance is related to the financial package and not towards turkey , and is related to the problems between italy , the european commission and some member countries of the union .
there has been tension between italy and the eu for a while now .
renzi continued to harshly criticize the chancellor of germany , angela merkel , and the eu in the latest eu summit on energy , banking and immigration .
criticizing the attitude of renzi in yesterday &apos;s press conference , juncker said that &quot; renzi should quit accusing the eu . &quot;
&quot; it is wrong of renzi , even though i like him very much , to humiliate the european commission on every occasion . &quot;
juncker implied that renzi plays to internal public opinion .
1 billion of the 3 billion euros , promised to turkey , will be covered by the eu budget .
2 billion euros will be covered by the budgets of the member countries .
germany will contribute at lest 427 million euros .
it has been decided that 2.3 billion euros will be transferred to the eu budget and used to support jordan and lebanon by the greek cypriot administration , which declared that it won &apos;t transfer money to turkey for political reasons .
the funds are predicted to be used during the 2016 @-@ 2017 period .
i cried when i saw the charlie hebdo cartoon
speaking to the russian official news agency sputnik , the father abdullah kurdi reacted strongly and said , &quot; to tell the truth , i cried because of that cartoon . &quot;
&quot; i felt very bad . &quot;
stating that he expected positive things from the french satirical magazine charlie hebdo , which has become the symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack , kurdi added the following :
they made a bad cartoon unfortunately .
everybody felt very sad about this cartoon .
aylan is a 2 year old boy and he died .
charlie hebdo was supposed to show respect to aylan , to me and my family , but the exact opposite is true .
this magazine should show respect to the dead children .
they published a disrespectful cartoon about our honourable prophet .
they even made publications regarding allah .
compared with the publications on allah and our prophet , what they done to my son is a small thing .
kurdi , living in erbil , made the following appeal : &quot; i call on the whole world and the satirical magazines to show respect to all the dead children . &quot;
they should not add to the grief the families are already suffering .
tima kurdi , an aunt of aylan kurdi living in canada , is also among those to react to the cartoon .
in the cartoon by laurent &quot; riss &quot; sourisseau , it is implied that 3 year old syrian aylan kurdi , whose dead body came ashore at bodrum , &quot; may have become one of the sex abusers in germany when he grows up . &quot;
last year , having been exposed to an attack in which religious radicals killed 12 people because of the publication of cartoons depicting muhammad , french satirical magazine charlie hebdo become the focus of discussions with its cartoon of aylan kurdi .
in the cartoon the molesters , with pig heads , evoking immigrants and also chasing women , who were portrayed like the women abused during the new year celebrations in germany , especially cologne .
having stirred up different reactions on social media , the cartoon is part of a column consisting of 4 frames .
&quot; this is not france &quot; is written on the column , and the lost values of france and increasing hostility against refugees are criticized according to many readers .
on the other hand , the cartoon caused many people to accuse charlie hebdo of racism .
while charlie hebdo praised germany , which accepted 800 thousand refugees , it criticized france for its unwilling attitude towards opening its doors to refugees in an issue published last year .
it was said in the cartoon &quot; the goal was too close &quot; and &quot; two children &apos;s menus for the price of one &quot; was written in the advertising poster .
&quot; autopsies in germany for the germans who died in sultanahmet &quot;
according to information on the website of the weekly magazine der spiegel , the german federal prosecutor &apos;s office decided that the bodies of the 10 people who died in the attack , will be brought to germany .
the bodies of the dead will be brought home today or tomorrow on a german air forces plane and will be welcomed by a ceremony at the airport .
experts from the identification commission of the federal criminal police office ( bka ) , who carry out forensic operations in germany , normally travel to the countries where an incident has occurred to conduct the identification and autopsy for german citizens killed in accidents or attacks .
however , the magazine der spiegel wrote that things will be done differently this time .
according to the magazine , officials from the federal criminal police office applied to turkish authorities to conduct the identification and autopsy operations in istanbul but the request was refused .
the federal criminal police office sent four experts to istanbul after the istanbul attack .
treatment is continuing on seven german tourists who were injured in the attack .

banning of male refugees from swimming pools
in a report in the german press , it was reported that the ban will be lifted if the volunteer workers from the dormitories notify them that the message has been understood by the refugees .
stating in his interview to wdr that the municipality does not want to punish innocent people because of the behaviour of a few people , an official from the social affairs department , markus schnapka , said that those staying in the dormitories had been informed in three languages about the important values in germany .

what are the benefits of steam cooking ?
a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in food , steam cooking is becoming increasingly popular .
steam cooking , one of the most preferred cooking methods in the far @-@ east for centuries , strengthens the metabolism and makes digestion easier .
bacteria and germs in food are completely eradicated with this method , which also eliminates problems such as dyspepsia .
substances found in foods such as protein , cellulose and starch completely disolve using this technique , making the food softer .
taking place in low pressure , steam cooking is done in a cooking pot with the help of steam pots or steam machines .
both the amount of water used and the cooking time is less when cooking at high pressure .
the best example of this is cooking in a pressure cooker .
especially for cooking dietary foods such as vegetables , it is necessary to wash the vegetables well first , and then it is necessary to put them into a strainer and wait for the water to strain .
one @-@ third of a deep cooking pot is filled with water and a steam strainer is placed inside the pot .
the mouth of the cooking pot is half closed .
in this way , we allow steam to escape from the cooking pot .
firstly the heat of the oven is set to the highest degree and the water is boiled ; after the temperature is fixed by setting the heat in the oven to a lower degree .
the vegetables and food are steam cooked for 10 @-@ 15 minutes and are then checked with the help of a fork once they are cooked .
the cooked vegetables are removed from the oven and served on plates .
appearance , colour and aroma of the food do not change with the steam cooking technique ; therefore this is a healthy method .
the distinctive taste of the food stays the same .
therefore the quality and flavour of the food are not spoiled .
loss of nutrition is kept to a minimum in steam cooking , which is also the most economical way of cooking .
steamed vegetables offer a satisfactory flavour for the diner with their fresh and vibrant appearance .
frequently used , especially as part of a diet , this method is often preferred also because it is very light .
david bowie - blackstar : the alien &apos;s &quot; last album &quot;
knowing that you will die ; producing that final album without telling anyone ; making your deathbed an artistic expression in the music video you shot ...
these kinds of actions may seem &quot; extreme &quot; to us mortal earthlings .
i say mortal earthlings because i am among those who believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien .
he came to our world from some corner of the universe ; now he has returned to his motherland ; which is just how it goes .
he came because it was necessary to inspire not only kiss , marilyn manson or lady gaga , but also all the singers of the world .
he fulfilled his duty with success .
david bowie , blackstar , itunes price : 9.99 tl 5 / 5
maybe he was nourished by warhol and kubrick from the same planet as him .
when apollo 11 landed on earth , he decided to say &quot; this is nothing , i am an alien , &quot; and he joined us by singing &quot; space oddity . &quot;
actually he did not join us ; he was always ahead of us .
thanks to him , many people found their way .
both musicians and listeners ...
if we leave aside his interest in plastic arts , his acting etc . , it would be wrong to say that his music was &quot; just music . &quot;
the characters he created by himself , travelling from song to song , his references , innovation , taboo @-@ breaking behaviour and discography reflect an artistic integrity for me .
i can remember him neither as the father of glam rock , nor as the cousin of punk ...
if i remember him like that , what will happen to his avant @-@ garde and electronic works , and to jazz , which he kept as an internal love since his childhood ?
david bowie always reminded us what the expression &quot; icon &quot; means , up until that time when the word spread like wildfire .
he was not a man ; he was not a woman ; he was not &quot; human . &quot;
he was a body .
it seemed to us that he was on a mission .
that body left this world two days after the release of his 26th studio album &quot; blackstar . &quot;
he tried to prepare us for the fact that he would leave with &quot; blackstar &quot; and &quot; lazarus , &quot; which we had listened to before the release of the album .
we thought that &quot; he has gotten old now , so he talks about death , &quot; but he was aware of everything .
one more final hand ...
we can say that there are four songs that we already knew when the album was released ; &quot; blackstar &quot; and &quot; lazarus , &quot; shouldering the burden of message and emotion , &quot; sue ( or in a season of crime ) &quot; and &quot; tis a pity she was a whore , &quot; previously released but re @-@ recorded for this album .
i would add that the remaining songs , &quot; girl loves me , &quot; &quot; i can &apos;t give everything away &quot; and &quot; dollar days , &quot; are also very good .
when we look at &quot; blackstar &quot; as a whole , it was created on a very strong musical structure , but it feels like it was produced with sincere and instantaneous feelings as well .
it is an album neither of death nor a &quot; reckoning with the past ... &quot;
it is just a real &quot; final &quot; album .
&quot; the end &quot; caption of a life in music , which is a masterpiece in its entirety .
turkey was targeted in the sultanahmet attack
on german tv channel ard , holger münch , head of the german federal criminal police office , gave details of the incident which occurred on tuesday in sultanahmet square and in which 10 german citizens lost their lives .
münch stated that the target of the attack was not german citizens , but turkey .
&quot; 400 people under surveillance &quot;

indicating that there was a decrease in the number of those travelling to syria to join isis , münch pointed out that many people have returned from the war zone .
saying that this is a big challenge to security forces , münch added &quot; now , there are approximately 400 people that we must keep under surveillance . &quot;
münch requested that coordination between police departments in europe be enhanced and that there be closer communication .
turkish authorities say that the suicide bomber who organized the sultanahmet attack was a citizen of syria and a member of isis ; thomas de maiziere , the german minister of internal affairs , stated that the attacker could not yet be identified .

a price increase of 25 kuruş on bread in ankara and istanbul
with an increase of 25 kuruş , 250g of bread began to be sold for 1 tl as of yesterday in ankara .
upon speculation that &quot; the price of bread would increase &quot; before the new year , especially in december , faruk çelik , minister of food , agriculture and livestock , and bülent tüfekçi , minister of customs and trade stated that &quot; there would be no price increase . &quot;
however , 250g of bread was selling for 1 tl yesterday in the capital , ankara .
the head of the turkish bakers &apos; federation , halil i̇brahim balcı stated that , regarding the 25 kuruş price increase on bread , &quot; no price increase was imposed , the price list of 2 years ago began to be applied &quot; and added :
&quot; it was a price decision taken 2 years ago . &quot;
the chamber of merchants &apos; union decided on this price 2 years ago .
it is a price implemented throughout turkey .
in other words , there was no application and implementation of a price increase .
however some bakeries sold bread for 75 kuruş in some regions of ankara due to competition .
in other regions , it was already being sold for 1 tl .
bakers , confident about the quality of their bread , did not decrease their prices . they have to implement 1 tl due to competition .
there is no price increase .
they are implementing the price that had not been implemented before .
&quot; the price of bread per kilo certainly won &apos;t exceed 5 tl in the first half of 2016 , and we will end this year with this price if we do not experience any major problems . &quot;
in some areas of istanbul , bread started to be sold for 1.25 tl .
bloody terror attack this time in burkina faso
23 people from 18 different countries were killed in the attack which targeted a luxury hotel known to be preferred by foreigners and officials from the united nations in the west african country burkina faso .
al qaeda &apos;s north africa branch claimed responsibility for the attack .
the attack in burkina faso occurred four days after the terrorist attack by isis on jakarta , the capital of indonesia , which is the most crowded muslim country in the world with a population of 250 million .
one canadian and one indonesian were killed in the gun and bomb attacks that were carried out during the daytime at a branch of starbucks and a police box on a busy street containing foreign embassies , luxurious hotels and shops .
indonesian officials explained that the attackers were inspired by the paris massacre on november 13 .
a security correspondent from english television channel the bbc , frank garner , pointed out that this attack was a part of a frightening tendency manifesting itself recently in different cities around the world .
the u.s. was also hurt by terrorist actions a short time ago .
14 people were killed in an armed attack carried out by a couple sympathetic to isil in san bernadino , california in the u.s. at the beginning of last december .
the &quot; san bernardino &quot; attack horrifies the u.s .
after the suicide bombing attack on sultanahmet that killed 10 german tourists , thomas de maiziere , the german minister of internal affairs , reminded us that there are many terrorist attacks occurring in many places around the world , and added , &quot; we have experienced two big attacks in paris . &quot;
if we say this , then terror will win ...
we used the expression &quot; standing firm . &quot;
isil have stopped using whatsapp , and now use the alrawi application
according to a new report , the terrorist organization isil is benefiting from its own chat tool for communicating without having to depend on applications such as whatsapp and telegram .
according to the report from defense one , the organization is benefiting from a new messaging application for messaging inside the organization .
named &quot; alrawi , &quot; this android application is distributed and installed via an apk file .
the application allows the organization to cipher messages and share media among themselves .
a surprising move from isil in iraq
according to ghost security group , functionality of the application is &quot; primitive &quot; in comparison with such popular applications as whatsapp and telegram .
for now , it is not known how strong the ciphering used is .
before this , isil carried out all of its communication via telegram , an application allowing messages to be sent on encrypted connections .
however , telegram revealed all the channels in which the isil members were chatting .
in addition to this , the u.s. government has requested that application developers put back @-@ doors in their applications .
for this reason , the organization has now started to use its own solutions rather than relying on the ciphering of whatsapp and telegram .

how to use the mid @-@ term break ?
how should students use the mid @-@ term break ? - we asked this question to educational specialist and student coach , murat aydın .
students should not only think of mid @-@ term break as spending time resting , entertaining and watching television .
mid @-@ term break is an important opportunity to get ready for the new school term and to review last term .
being free time , the mid @-@ term break is also a good opportunity for personality development , acquisition of knowledge and skills , and taking up a new hobby .
make a list of what to do during the term .
write down everything you plan to do , and try to put it into practice .
you can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more efficient term .
now , firstly , let &apos;s talk about how efficient the term should be for students preparing for the ygs @-@ lys exams .
because the most common questions coming from the students preparing for ygs @-@ lys are as follows : &quot; how should we use this time , should we solve a lot of questions or finish incomplete subjects ? &quot;
firstly , lets introduce our article with both the answers to these questions and some advice to those who are preparing for the exam in order to spend the time efficiently .
while the preparation period for the exams should be a process that starts from the 9th grade , under normal conditions , we are trying instead to complete it in the final 1 year ; this obliges us to spend our last year more effectively , by using our time more efficiently and properly .
a final grade student must deal with both the exam preparation and preparation for school written exams at the same time .
even if the graduate students have finished school and experienced the exam ( ygs @-@ lys ) at least once , the year they prepare for the exam again as a graduate student is critically important for them as well .
because most graduate students and their families see &quot; that &quot; year as a last chance , which creates greater stress .
revision is the study that students do not like ; they do it because they feel obliged to do it ; and therefore they always postpone it to the last moment ; but it becomes completely a duty for the students that do it regularly and make it a habit ; and there is always a plan for what and when things need to be done .
now we have a mid @-@ term break ahead of us and we have to use it in the best way possible .
to do this , we should always have a plan that allows us to manage our time well .
studying for lessons during mid @-@ term break :
firstly , everyone should make a plan suitable to their situation .
1 . they should include what they have covered , what are the incomplete subjects in their plan and they should plan their days , weeks and 15 @-@ day periods .
there should be both lesson revision and question solving in this period .
in the meantime , students that do not have any incomplete subjects can solve 1 or 2 mock exams on average .
deal with your incomplete subjects : studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week , 66 percent in a day , and 54 percent in an hour .
the best and most effective method of eliminating this tendency to forget is by doing revision .
especially students who make too many errors in prior lessons should concentrate on studying with general revision .
firstly , determine what are the incomplete subjects and make your plan everyday ; choose one lesson everyday and completely deal with it .
this planning will help you in both academic and psychological situations .
when adding subjects to your plan , pay attention to the subjects you make the most errors in .
because there will be no long holiday periods in the future .
solve questions :
question solving is as important as revising lessons .
because we can see how much we understand the subjects we study only through the feedback from the questions we solve .
do not forget to select a number of questions to be solved each day .
the number of questions you solve may change in line with what you study ; you may not solve many questions on a day that you mostly study lessons , but we should still solve questions to a certain extent , at least in order to see how much we learned from the lesson of that day .
solve mock exams :
another area of study to look into during mid @-@ term break should be solving mock exams .
even if all the subjects are not finished , you can solve mock exams at least for each lesson .
supposing that you finished a turkish lesson , you can solve a 40 @-@ question mock exam of turkish .
you should definitely keep track of time while doing this .
if you solve 40 turkish questions in 60 minutes , your next target should be to complete it several minutes faster .
vacation and hobby plans :
of course , a break does not only mean studying for lessons , you should spare a few days for vacation , to rest and spend time on your hobbies .
a holiday period spent only studying for lessons will stop you from having fun and relaxing .
for this reason , there should be special time set aside for yourself .
reading books , watching television or surfing the internet may be in your plans , but the most important thing is how much time you spare for each activity .
i have some advice for those who say that i could not spend the first term efficiently .
if you can say that i could not spend the first term well , i could not study much and i missed many lessons , this mid @-@ term break is a big opportunity for you as well .
nevertheless , you should firstly decide on and believe this .
most of the goals in the 2009 @-@ 2010 turkish super league were scored between minutes 76 and 90 .
now , answer the question you ask ; do you go to the locker room after the end of the match or is the match still continuing and is there enough time for you to score a goal ?
i suppose that no one wants to say , &quot; we will look forward to our next match , &quot; a conventional expression used by the coach or players of a losing football team .
now , the only thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past , and run instead of walking .
to summarize what we said :
1 ) firstly make a mid @-@ term break plan ,
2 ) revise the lessons you know ,
3 ) finish any incomplete subjects ,
4 ) consolidate what you have learned by solving questions ,
5 ) solve mock exams ,
6 ) read books ,
7 ) determine new goals for next term ,
8 ) spare time for you , your hobbies and the things you enjoy ,
9 ) spare time for your family and your friends ,
10 ) spare time for social and cultural activities ( cinema , sport , theatre , concert , travel , picnics , etc . )

carrying out production , export and retailing with his partner alev pakten , home sweet home &apos;s chairman , kadir kalaycıoğlu stated that they are very happy with the merger with kervan and added , &quot; we are from mardin and entered this sector in 1998 . &quot;
from the very beginning , we created a brand with the support of mr. şinasi .
mr. şinasi is like the &quot; trt &quot; of this sector .
we learned a lot from him as well .
moreover , we took our first steps in retail when he gave us his store in akmerkez .
in fact , we were working with kervan as a strategical partner , not a rival .
&quot; from now on , a very important synergy will emerge with this merger . &quot;
kalaycıoğlu explained that there are 17 home sweet home stores abroad , most of which are in the middle east ; and they started exports to china last month .
kalaycıoğlu said , &quot; we opened our first corner in shanghai . &quot;
we agreed with a chain store which has 200 stores .
&quot; from now on , we will develop big retailing as kervan and small retailing with home sweet home abroad . &quot;

yıldız holding becomes pladis abroad
yıldız holding combined all the acquired global companies , active in the biscuit and chocolate sectors , under the name &quot; pladis . &quot;
with the merger combining the brands de met &apos;s , godiva , united biscuits and ülker , a new food giant worth 5.2 billion dollars was born , in which 26 thousand employees work .
speaking at a meeting related to the merger of the global companies within yıldız holding , murat ülker , yıldız holding &apos;s chairman , said , &quot; to be a global company was our target from the beginning &quot; and added :
murat ülker broadcast the 335 million turkish lira sale live on periscope
founded 72 years ago , this company is now proceeding under the name &quot; yıldız holding &quot; and becoming a global brand , a global company around the world in the business of biscuits , chocolate and confectionery .
in this period , we have advanced in various branches of the industry from retailing to packaging , from real estate to personal care in addition to biscuits , chocolate and confectionery .
we are in thousands of sales points with 77 factories and 300 brands , which are active in 14 countries .
stating that all of yıldız holding has created a &quot; family of more than 50 thousand people , &quot; ülker said , &quot; now , when we look at the possibilities of our family , we want to go back and focus on biscuits , chocolate and confectionery , namely our main business ; we are getting reorganized for this , &quot; and he talked about the new structuring as follows :
life story of the father of ülker , mr. sabri
we are now re @-@ evaluating our company structure and getting reorganized .
we have divided the world into regions .
and we distributed these regions to our ceos .
mehmet , mohammed and jeff will be our regional ceos .

mohamed elsarky is responsible for the continent of america and japan , in addition to our godiva business .
jeff van der eems will be responsible for the united kingdom , continental europe and africa .
while ali ülker , who i can say is a quality and innovation guru , undertakes a global responsibility in his area , cem karakaş will help me in the administration of the job .
china , russia and part of south @-@ east asia will be the regions we will establish and develop .
murat ülker sold a share in saf real estate investment trust
he continued , &quot; we are promising happiness to the whole world in every bite , &quot; murat ülker said , &quot; the name of our global firm is pladis , which we established to make this promise real . &quot;
he said , &quot; if you ask from where the name pladis comes , actually the name has no special meaning &quot; and added :
aztecs called it maya .
japanese people , subaru , pervin in iran .
süreyya in arabic ; we gained inspiration from the name of the star cluster , pleiades , which is made up of seven stars and means ülker in latin .
and so , we translated ülker globally .
vice chairman of the board of yıldız holding , ali ülker , underlined that they &quot; started to create a synergy in innovation &quot; by collaborating with laboratories in different countries , and added :
we have very valuable r &amp; d teams ; we gained certain synergies so far from the work on the r &amp; d platform by gathering these teams together .
we have 27 r &amp; d centres under pladis .
the biggest ones are in the united kingdom and turkey .
more than 300 r &amp; d specialists are working here .
synergy projects have already started to produce results .
produced by ülker with export to united kingdom due to start , digestive balls ( nibbles ) are produced in the chocolate factory of ülker in silivri .
another example of synergy : ülker krispi tırtıklı , which are the same products but with different brands .
by adapting cracker technology developed in the united kingdom , namely the product jacob &apos;s crinklys , into turkey in a short time , we brought the pleasant taste to turkey under the name ülker krispi tırtıklı .
very well known by everyone , laviva was introduced to consumers in the u.s. today .
call of duty series exceeds the 250 million mark
with their names being written in gold letters in the games world , the series of games by activision , infinity ward , treyarch and sledgehammer games seem not to be forgotten for many years .
the newly announced sales figures especially prove how much we should find this series legendary .
activision , who hold the licencing rights of the series , showed that 250 million copies were sold in the end of tear special sales issue .
sharing the sales figures for all the series at the beginning of last year , the company succeeded in selling 75 million copies of the game call of duty from that time to now .
if we say that the main part of this issue is made up of black ops 3 , we won &apos;t be much mistaken .
kemal kılıçdaroğlu was elected as general president again
kemal kılıçdaroğlu was elected as the general president again in the regular congress .
receiving the votes of 990 delegates out of 1238 , kılıçdaroğlu became general president again .
248 of the votes cast were declared null and void .
party members cheered after the results were announced .
chp had 1275 delegates in total .
the congress finished its endeavours and gathered at 10 : 00am on sunday .
in the congress , kılıçdaroğlu stated the following in his summary :
we would have liked people to dance and sing folk songs here .
however , where we stand now is underwhelming .
the reality is that turkey could not be governed .
the resulting atmosphere overshadows all of that .
the cause of the pessimism is those who are governing the country .
as a member of chp , we are against terror no matter where it comes from .
terror is a crime against humanity and the terrorists should not be forgiven .
the fight against terrorism is carried out with intelligence , knowledge and comprehension .
we certainly want to fight against it , and we want everybody to be untouched .
what is the difference between the photographs from the southeast and the photographs from syria and lebanon ?
when they came to the table , they made serious mistakes .
the government is responsible for all the bloodshed , tears and victims .
they took over this country with zero terrorism in 2002 , but today turkey has turned into a bloodbath .
who is responsible for them ?
the taxi driver şehmuz in diyarbakır ?
for what does turkey pay the price ?
we will participate genuinely in the meetings to change the coup d &apos;etat laws , we will offer our opinions .
we won &apos;t let anybody build a country on their personal views .
i say , &quot; let &apos;s change the pro @-@ coup mindset . &quot;
the houses of this country &apos;s intellectuals are raided and they are taken into custody because they gave their opinion .
there are parts of what they say we do not agree with , but people should be able to offer their opinions freely .
this tinpot dictator says , &quot; those who benefit from the state , treat it as an enemy . &quot;
i would also like to ask him ; those who benefit from the state , and use all the opportunities of the state , why don &apos;t they think about it when they rob the country ?
chp is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country .
we will make preparations together for the fourth biggest revolution .
we will definitely bring libertarian democracy to this country no matter what it costs .
they may detain us , they may take us into custody ; chp will bring freedom to this country no matter what they do , no matter how heavy the price .
i &apos;m making a clear , straight call to you , davutoğlu .
do not hide behind the coup d &apos;etat laws , those who hide behind them do not banish from one &apos;s mind the coup mentality .
you gave a meritorious service medal to someone who gave a warning to you .
which coup are you talking about ?
it is completely aimed at deceiving the people .
party officials listed the other 3 revolutions as follows : the 1st big revolution is the foundation of the republic by putting an end to the sultanate ; the 2nd big revolution is the passing from the single party era to the multi @-@ party era in the time of i̇nönü ; the 3rd big revolution is passing into social democracy with bülent ecevit ...
there are qualifications and duties of the president .
there is a president &apos;s oath in article 103 .
we know how important the concepts of honesty and honour are in this society .
if someone comes out and gives this promise , they should keep their word to the death .
because honesty and honour are indisputable for us .
what do honesty and honour mean for you , tinpot dictator ?
what do you understand from honesty and honour , why did you take this oath ?
what do honesty and honour mean to you ?
i want to learn this .
the concepts of honesty and honour are held in high esteem by religious people .
their intention is not to abolish the law of the coup , but to fortify the law of the coup .
it does not suffice and they want the presidential system .
what kind of presidency ; it is a presidential system with a boss .
why do you reject the ottoman parliamentary system ?
one person commands and everybody does what is necessary .
do we have a healthy parliament in turkey that works ?
no , it does not work .
if we bring libertarian democracy , the system will work .
they repeatedly say coup but they are strengthening the law of the coup .
declaring his nomination for candidacy of the general presidency , i̇zmir deputy mustafa balbay could not join the race because he could not gather the signatures of 128 delegates necessary for the candidacy .
gathering 92 signatures , balbay said , &quot; i am not able to become a candidate under present conditions . &quot;
the thing that attracted attention was that the previous chp leader deniz baykal sat in the tribunes with party members instead of the seats allocated to deputies and members of the party council ( pm ) , the central executive board ( myk ) and honorary board .
istanbul deputy gülay yedekçi arrived early and sat near the section allocated to the general president kılıçdaroğlu instead of sitting in the area allocated to the deputies .
one of the things most spoken about in the backstage of the congress was the conversation between klıçdaroğlu and the yalova deputy muharrem i̇nce .
i̇nce explained that membership of the party council was offered to him , but he did not accept it .
however , sources from central office claim that the meeting request came from i̇nce and membership of the party council was not offered to him .
ince shared a message on twitter , &quot; no matter who they are , the sources from the central office can get the details of the conversation from the istanbul deputy ali özcan . &quot;
özcan said , &quot; how can i know about the conversation between two people . &quot;
he only said , &quot; he went and spoke with him . &quot;
kılıçdaroğlu &apos;s son applauded his &quot; father &quot; repeatedly .
the backstage of the party council left its mark on the first day of the ordinary &quot; congress of democracy , change and brotherhood . &quot;
after his speech at the congress , kılıçdaroğlu went to his home and started to work on the list of party council .
it was understood that while preparing the key list of 100 people , he called the 13 central executive board ( myk ) members and said he would include them in the list ; except for the current central executive board members yakup akkaya , sencer ayata and ercan karakaş , who declared that they did not want to be on the executive and did not apply for the party council ( pm ) , and seyhan erdoğdu , who applied once more to the party council .
it is stated that kılıçdaroğlu may refer to another narrow list in addition to the 100 person @-@ key list of the party council .
in the 21 article @-@ final declaration , accepted unanimously at the chp congress , the abolishment of the annotation on the european charter of local self @-@ government was requested , which was brought into the agenda with the self government discussions of dtk , and the increase of the authority share in the local affairs .
incleded in the declaration were the aims of &quot; ending of the party state system &quot; and &quot; establishment of a transparent and accountable rule of law . &quot;
vice chairman of the ak party selçuk özdağ , i̇dris baluken from hdp and ruhsar demirel from mhp watched the congress .
ak party member özdağ and the delegation from the ak party left the hall when kılıçdaroğlu harshly criticized president erdoğan .
özdağ said , &quot; i saw that he knows no boundaries of criticizing , it was not possible for me to accept it . &quot;
the banner with photos of the arrested journalists can dündar and erdem gül and the text &quot; if i don &apos;t burn , if you don &apos;t burn , if we don &apos;t burn , how will the light vanquish the darkness ? , &quot; and the banner of &quot; peace &quot; in english , turkish and kurdish attracted attention in the hall .
the congress started in the morning with the songs of group yorum and ahmet kaya .
there was big applause for the message sent by türkan elçi , wife of the bar president of diyarbakır tahir elçi , who was killed in an armed assault .
berkin elvan &apos;s mother gülsüm and father sami elvan also participated in the congress .
the most applauded part of the speech was the part in which kılıçdaroğlu said that they will embrace democracy &quot; to the death &quot; no matter what price they have to pay .
having assembled 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary congresses , 52 congresses in total until now , chp assembled the 53rd big congress in ankara arena yesterday .
participation was high .
there were more than 15 thousand chp members in the hall with a capacity of 12 thousand seats .
however , the crowd didn &apos;t do justice to this number with their enthusiasm .
the most exciting moment was the moment in which kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife selvi kılıçdaroğlu .
the excitement continued when the kılıçdaroğlu couple greeted the hall with a wave .
there is no trace of the discipline seen in the congresses of the ak party .
there was a lot of movement in the ground area of the arena even when kılıçdaroğlu was making speech .
it was obvious that the chp members , wanting to enter the party council , preferred to seek support by talking about themselves to party executives and journalists .
one of the chp executives tried to explain that this situation was not a bad thing by saying , &quot; it is better than sitting down without moving and lining up the walk @-@ on party members as in the party meetings of korea or the soviet union . &quot;
the chp congress has one more difference from the congresses of the ak party or mhp .
in these parties , only the general president talks .
in chp , the congress becomes a platform in which the problems of the party are discussed .
when the number of party members wanting to speak increased , council chairman murat karayalçın had difficulty in adjusting the time .
there was the expression &quot; the homeland goes bad &quot; in their faces , and there was a distance to the comments &quot; you will then change this course of events with the result coming from this hall . &quot;
all the chp members said , &quot; something should be done , &quot; but there wasn &apos;t a strong and coherent answer to the question of &quot; what should be done . &quot;
the fact that there will be no election in the next 4 years had a big effect on the situation .
when kılıçdaroğlu went up to the rostrum , we journalists waited for his answer to the question &quot; what should be done . &quot;
firstly , kılıçdaroğlu answered the question &quot; what is going on . &quot;
he highlighted the issue of the arrested journalists , what was done to academics because of the declaration , what took place in the southeast , the deadlock that foreign policy has come to .
he repeatedly answered the &quot; legends of anatolia &quot; issue related to his chp party , such as , &quot; it is a party of non @-@ believers , &quot; &quot; it supports coups d &apos;état &quot; and &quot; it is the party of elitists . &quot;
when it comes to the &quot; what should be done &quot; stage , he tried to put forward a &quot; strategy &quot; rather than discussing concrete steps .
he stressed that all of these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice .
he gave a promise on behalf of chp and said , &quot; we will work no matter what it costs until we bring democracy . &quot;
&quot; we will struggle to the death for democracy . &quot;
one last note : it is necessary to remember that chp have solved the issue of &quot; organization &quot; as of the 53rd congress , and it now succeeds in assembling a congress without problem .
on another note , cards were printed for 900 journalists said to be attending the congress , but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level .
representatives of media organizations from ankara were not as eager as they were for the congresses of the ak party .
life sentence was demanded for autonomy
the indictment , prepared by the chief public prosecutor &apos;s office against 7 suspects , 3 of whom are in detention , was accepted by the 4th high criminal court .
in the indictment , it was stated that declarations under the name of &quot; autonomy &quot; were made in some districts and neighbourhoods of diyarbakır , i̇stanbul , şırnak , mardin , muş , hakkari , siirt , bitlis , batman , van and ağrı upon the directions and calls by senior executives of the terrorist organization pkk / kck .
indicating that there were calls for illegal actions by the ringleaders and the youth and woman formations of the organization , the indictment noted that there was an increase in the actions of bombing , long barrelled weapon and rocket launcher attacks on the security forces , public institutions and organizations and people &apos;s houses , workplaces and vehicles in the sur , bağlar , silvan , bismil , lice , dicle and hazro districts of diyarbakır .
isis clashed with opponents ; our police station was hit
the clashes recently seen between isis and the army of conquest , formed by a group of rebel militias , are becoming violent and continue in the syrian villages of dudiyan , qarah mazr &apos;ah , baghidin and qarah kubri on the opposite side of the yavuzlu village of kilis .
during the clashes between isis and its opponents close to the border , gunfire and the noise of mortars can also be heard in turkey .
coming from the region in which explosions occur frequently , smoke could be seen from turkey with the naked eye , and security forces took concentrated precautions with armoured cars on the border .
on the other hand , harassment fire was opened from the baghidin village under the control of isis militants at the martyr mehmet police station on the border near the yavuzlu village in kilis .
then , soldiers responded to the area from which the harassment fire was coming , with howitzer and heavy guns within the rules of engagement .
according to claims , russian warplanes organized an attack on the village of hameyin , which is 17 kilometres from the turkish border .
wounded by the aerial bombing , 6 syrians were brought to the state hospital of kilis by relatives .
lottery winners receive their cheque
living in a small 150 thousand dollar house in munford , tennessee , the robinson couple chose to receive 328 million dollars ( around 1 billion tl ) in a single payment rather than receiving a total sum of 528.8 million dollars ( 1.6 billion tl ) over 29 years .

the couple aims to firstly pay off their mortgage and to help their relatives with the money they won .
it was announced that the jackpot was divided in three large payments .
ios 9 : how to get new iphone operating system , as apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by heading to the settings app , tapping &quot; general , &quot; and then selecting &quot; software update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down , or to try and upgrade through itunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
that might include deleting apps to make space - but apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re @-@ install them once the process is over .
it &apos;s worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens , so that it doesn &apos;t run out of battery .
if the charge is too low , apple won &apos;t let the update go ahead , since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking .

fedex earnings mixed , lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
fedex reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full @-@ year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division .
the company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , fedex announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of wednesday &apos;s opening bell .
fedex corp. said that it expects to earn between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next may , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
analysts expected $ 10.84 , according to a survey by factset .
the reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent , which will take effect jan. 4 , and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages , which begin in november .
the company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost @-@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commerce .
chairman and ceo fred smith said the company was &quot; performing solidly given weaker @-@ than @-@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the holiday @-@ hiring plans were announced a day after rival ups said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
in the quarter that ended aug. 31 , fedex earned $ 692 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 , short of the $ 2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by zacks investment research .
revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.3 billion .
six analysts surveyed by zacks expected $ 12.23 billion .
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping , which has caused revenue in its express unit to stagnate .
but the boom in online shopping has boosted results at fedex ground .
in the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs .
in premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell , fedex shares were down $ 3.85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 150.15 .
they closed tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on june 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in years , federal reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27 @-@ foot honduran mahogany table deciding if it &apos;s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
looming over them at one end of the central bank &apos;s ornate , two @-@ story boardroom will be a mural of the united states .
the map is a reminder that fed chairwoman janet l. yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation &apos;s economic interests above all others .
the central bank has a dual charge from congress : maximize u.s. employment and keep prices here stable .
but since the great recession , fed leaders have acknowledged that there &apos;s an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
and that third mandate could be the x @-@ factor in a too @-@ close @-@ to @-@ predict decision , to be announced thursday , about whether the u.s. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
even though most data show the economy growing solidly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already @-@ cautious fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch , &quot; said lindsey m. piegza , chief economist at brokerage firm stifel nicolaus &amp; co .
&quot; but i think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further , &quot; she said .
there &apos;s no consensus about what the fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market jitters .
about half of economists surveyed recently by bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , are expecting the fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
that would point to a stock market drop if the fed raises the rate , unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
on tuesday , the dow jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,599.85 .
the rally was triggered by expectations that fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week , said john lonski , chief economist at moody &apos;s capital markets research group .
&quot; it would be a surprise if the fed hiked rates at this point in time , &quot; he said .
if fed policymakers did , &quot; they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets &apos; hands so they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the fed would act .
just a month ago , the fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the u.s. recovery .
yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
although job creation slowed in august , labor market growth has been solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the fed considers to be full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of picking up .
and although inflation continued to run below the central bank &apos;s annual 2 % target , fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tightness of the labor market , &quot; said ian shepherdson , chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics .
but financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after china devalued its currency .
the dow jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in may as investors feared a slowing chinese economy would drag down global growth .
the market has rebounded somewhat this month , with the dow now down nearly 10 % from the may high .
for fed policymakers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate .
&quot; absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , &quot; said stephen d. oliner , a senior research fellow at the ucla ziman center for real estate and a former fed official .
now , he predicts they &apos;ll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the u.s. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post @-@ dates the developments in china , &quot; oliner said .
the health of the global economy isn &apos;t one of the fed &apos;s primary concerns , so technically it shouldn &apos;t be factored into its decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint by then @-@ chairman ben s. bernanke in 2013 that the fed might &quot; taper &quot; its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined , fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
its decision @-@ making process is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said zachary karabell , head of global strategy for wealth @-@ management firm envestnet inc .
jeffrey lacker , president of the federal reserve bank of richmond , va . , noted this month that &quot; the fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals . &quot;
lacker , a voting member of the policymaking federal open market committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 @-@ 99 as an example .
a financial crisis in asia led the fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings &quot; despite limited identifiable implications for u.s. growth , &quot; lacker said .
a year later , fed officials reversed those cuts .
the fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said adam s. posen , a former member of the bank of england &apos;s rate @-@ setting committee .
the latest turmoil doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; you certainly don &apos;t want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , &quot; said posen , president of the peterson institute for international economics .
the federal reserve act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , i don &apos;t think they should get ahead of the curve .

brazil &apos;s pediatric society of rio grande promotes healthy breastfeeding diets
brazilian pediatric organization sprs has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding , by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food .
human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates , which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system .
due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by robert waterland , a professor at the baylor college of medicine in texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors .
unfortunately , unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child &apos;s immune system .
seven &apos;s sunrise dominates ratings , despite nine &apos;s attempts to cover the leadership spill on today show
karl stefanovic and lisa wilkinson &apos;s dash to canberra to cover the aftermath of the liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for today .
nine &apos;s breakfast show screened from the national capital after malcolm turnbull &apos;s overthrow of tony abbott .
rival sunrise , hosted by david koch and samantha armytage , was stuck in london as part of a week @-@ long series of international telecasts which also include dubai , new york , niagara falls and cancun .
that tyranny of distance didn &apos;t seem to matter much to aussie tv viewers with sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to today &apos;s 339,000 .
today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for monday ( 317,000 ) and last tuesday ( 283,000 ) but its figure was behind last thursday &apos;s ( 343,000 ) .
today has been closing the gap on sunrise in recent months .
in august , today averaged 318,000 to sunrise &apos;s 330,000 .
at the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so far in september , sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to today &apos;s 314,000 .
this is the most interesting thing that &apos;s happened all morning .
the winds of change are affecting more than parliament this morning folks !
karl and lisa are fine , thanks for checking !

the final three agree bachelor sam wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
lana jeavons @-@ fellows , sarah mackay and snezana markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins the bachelor .
the woman who sam wood ends up with on the bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy .
and the three girls left standing certainly aren &apos;t letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose .
but when we checked in with sarah mackay , snezana markoski and lana jeavons @-@ fellows the day before three become two , they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be .
sam wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until thursday &apos;s finale
all three women waxed lyrical over why wood is the perfect man , citing his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
however when asked the question , &quot; if not you , who should get wood &apos;s final rose ? , &quot; their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the bachelors heart .
both jeavons @-@ fellows and markoski were quick to name mackay as , apart from themselves , the best match for wood .
sarah mackay and sam wood have shared an easy rapport since day one .
&quot; from the moment i walked into the house , reading ( sarah &apos;s ) energy and sam &apos;s energy i felt like they were quite compatible and i kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said jeavons @-@ fellows .
&quot; sarah is really down to earth , she &apos;s so much fun to be around , &quot; added markoski .
i &apos;ve seen them together and they do have that chemistry there .
they do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
sarah mackay believes she and sam wood would be well suited as a couple .
for her part , mackay said last week &apos;s home visit dates made her realise wood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; once i saw him with my friends and family i realised this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - i &apos;m wholeheartedly invested in him now , &quot; she said .
and asked who wood should choose if not her , she was enigmatic .
&quot; i don &apos;t know if i can say , &quot; she said .
i love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between snezana and lana .
the bachelor airs wednesday , 7.30pm on ten .

jarryd hayne had several options of where to begin his nfl career .
detroit and seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the us - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
but hayne chose the san francisco 49ers and coach jim tomsula and it &apos;s looking like a wise decision .
some coaches would have benched hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in tuesday &apos;s 20 @-@ 3 win against minnesota .
but tomsula showed faith in his man , giving hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to reggie bush .
tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game .
instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
tomsula also backed hayne publicly in his post @-@ match press conference .
49ers beat reporter cam inman reported that hayne also received encouragement from special teams co @-@ ordinator thomas mcgaughey , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
jarryd hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the minnesota vikings during the first quarter
it was certainly not the start hayne and his massive australian following had been hoping for in his nfl debut .
hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told australian radio duo hamish &amp; andy on 2dayfm 104.1 he couldn &apos;t have imagined a worse start to his nfl career .
&quot; it was just one of those things , you just worry about the next play and that &apos;s it , &quot; said hayne .
hayne likened the blunder to his origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ goal led to a queensland try .
overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

4 killed after police fire rubber bullets at protesters in nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country &apos;s proposed new constitution , an official said on wednesday .
the violence occurred tuesday evening in the district of rupandehi , about 175 miles west of kathmandu , the capital .
bishnu prasad dhakal , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and firebombs .
mr. dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less @-@ lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
the clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence .
there have also been protests in western nepal from ethnic tharus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since aug .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in april .
lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in kathmandu this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by sunday .

google launches donation @-@ matching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
google inc ( googl.o ) announced a donation @-@ matching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed european nations as they flee war @-@ torn and impoverished countries .
google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog .
rather than having an executive make the announcement , rita masoud , a google employee who fled kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
&quot; our journey involved many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
i was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis in europe has grown , many people like my family are desperate for help .
the donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , international rescue committee , save the children and un high commissioner for refugees .
google said it will match the first $ 5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com / refugeerelief until it raises $ 11 million .
europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since world war ii , largely driven by the four @-@ year @-@ old civil war in syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
many are also fleeing war @-@ torn afghanistan , yemen , iraq and libya .

for mildly obese diabetics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
it &apos;s still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments , however .
&quot; the mortality data take a long time to show up , &quot; said dr. robin blackstone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in jama surgery .
weight loss operations , or bariatric surgery , use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese , with a body mass index ( bmi ) of 35 or above .
bmi , a measure of weight in relation to height , is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9 .
a bmi of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a bmi over 30 are considered obese .
you can calculate your bmi here : 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv .
for the new study , researchers from taiwan &apos;s min @-@ sheng general hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese .
the average bmi among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
meanwhile , the bmi among those receiving non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent .
in the medically @-@ treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent .
in addition , control of blood pressure , triglycerides , and &quot; bad &quot; ldl cholesterol &quot; was generally better in the surgical group , &quot; the authors found .
the researchers also monitored patients &apos; blood levels of hemoglobin a1c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
hemoglobin a1c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , the average hemoglobin a1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glycemic control &quot; - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin a1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years , according to lead researcher dr. chih @-@ cheng hsu and colleagues .
the research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
at the fifth year , compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.7 vs 14.2 kg ) , achieved larger drops in bmi ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and in hemoglobin a1c ( 3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission ( 46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says blackstone , of the university of arizona college of medicine @-@ phoenix .
in the swedish study , obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conventional methods .
though the new study didn &apos;t show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , blackstone said it &apos;s reassuring for people with a bmi under 35 interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower bmi group , &quot; with no increased risk of death or renal disease , she said .
blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s bmi falls between 27 and 30 .
&quot; i think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , &quot; she said .
i think that once they &apos;ve accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes , reversing that is really hard .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to europe &quot; - dalai lama - rt news
europe could not host all refugees , the dalai lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the middle east .
the tibetan buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees &quot; home countries .
the dalai lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the dalai lama centre for compassion in oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies , at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the uk .
he claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents .
he also stressed that , however admirable , the west @-@ european countries &quot; response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation .
&quot; it it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the dalai lama praised germany &apos;s and austria &apos;s efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; so taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these muslim countries , &quot; he emphasized .
ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
addressing the issue of violence , the dalai lama also commented on george bush &apos;s actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the us &quot; violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events .
after 9 / 11 i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non @-@ violence .
i know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , &quot; the dalai lama said .
fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
poison control centers around the united states have reported a nearly 400 @-@ percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly @-@ alcoholic hand sanitizer , according to the georgia poison center .
according to dr. gaylord lopez , director of the georgia poison center , hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014 .
&quot; kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there &apos;s a percentage of them going to the emergency room , &quot; lopez told cnn .
he said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally , while some do it to impress their friends or on a social @-@ media dare .
videos on youtube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz .
teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol @-@ containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink .
younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents .
&quot; a kid is not thinking this is bad for them , &quot; lopez said .
a lot of the more attractive ( hand sanitizers ) are the ones that are scented .
there are strawberry , grape , orange @-@ flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids .
hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
in young children , especially , only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; dr. stephen thornton , medical director of the poison control center at university of kansas hospital , told fox 4 in kansas city .
so you wouldn &apos;t leave a shot of whiskey sitting around , but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
nhaijah russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry @-@ scented hand sanitizer at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood @-@ alcohol level was .179 , twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult , according to dr. chris ritchey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at gwinnett medical center outside of atlanta .
nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children &apos;s hospital for any signs of brain trauma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , ritchey said .
&quot; that was very scary , &quot; ortoria scott , nhaijah &apos;s mother , told cnn .
it could have been very lethal for my child .
lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol poisoning , some sanitizers have been linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic , undeclared ingredient .
health officials surmised that the product contained methanol , a deadly agent , rather than ethyl alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredient .
in january , three fourth @-@ grade students in upstate new york plotted to poison their &quot; mean &quot; teacher &quot; by putting antibacterial products around the classroom , &quot; according to a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room .
police considered the foiled plan to be &quot; idle chatter , &quot; referring discipline to the school district .

cruel fate is innocent
how humanist i am today .
i desire that there be no death .
but , how is it possible !
this world is cruel .
fortune is fickle .
there is death in destiny .
pain as well .
alien invasion as well .
lightning strikes as well .
sometimes a crashing space shuttle .
maybe a meteor .
what i am saying is that do not let death occur .
what i am saying is that let &apos;s sign our names .
let &apos;s react .
let &apos;s say cruel fate , what a disaster !
let our humanism grow .
let shame fall to fate &apos;s share .
but it does not feel ashamed , god @-@ damn it !

cruel fate .
no , fate is not cruel .
cruel fate is innocent !
the killer is walking around outside freely , looking at our faces and grinning .
some people struggle to shift their attention in another direction .
while the killer is before our eyes , they create opportunities to escape instead of pointing at the killer .
they become a shield for the killer .
they hide him .
once out of sight , they tell everybody that actually he is not guilty .
the sides are very clear in the fight we have experienced for the last 10 years .
some people desire that the circle of fire around us tightens and burns us .
some people try to prevent this , they even try to put out the fire .
some people only care about demolishing , looting .
some people only care about constructing , producing .
there are people who deem all kinds of war appropriate to us .
civil war .
inter @-@ state war .
sectarian war .
proxy war .
there are their sub @-@ contractors as well .
filthy terrorist organisations .
bloody @-@ minded clowns .
in different names , different formats .
turkey has no chance other than to fight against each of them .
it is fighting and for this reason it has to deal with all of their evil .
keep going until there is no danger of their evil ...

işık expressed that the data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information can be kept together and queried thanks to bali̇sti̇ka .
drawing attention to the fact that one of the most important features of bali̇sti̇ka is its capability to allow three @-@ dimensional data to be obtained and shown which gives more details and less errors , işık stresses that ballistics specialists can make decisions more rapidly and their success rate increases thanks to the innovations offered by the system .
bali̇sti̇ka was exported within the &quot; suba @-@ 1 project &quot;

a bus @-@ sized crocodile fossil was found
it was reported that the salt water crocodile from the prehistoric age has a length of approximately 10 metres and weighed 3 tonnes .
just the length of the crocodile &apos;s skull was measured as 1.6 metres .
the researchers named the species &quot; machimosaurus rex &quot; and published their findings in the magazine cretaceous research .
the lead author of the article , federico fanti from bologna university , stated that the fossil was understood to date from 130 million years ago and &quot; it is nearly the size of a bus . &quot;
speaking to the washington post , fanti said that the huge salt water crocodile &quot; was at the top of the food chain at least in a certain region , during that age . &quot;
palaeontologists stated that m. rex , believed to be the biggest crocodile living in the sea , hunted in lagoons by lying in wait .
it is thought that the biggest fresh water crocodile in history is the &quot; sarcosuchus imperator , &quot; which lived in africa and south america 110 million years ago and could reach 12 metres in length and 8 tonnes in weight .
all their minds are very confused !
the first book from writer ece temelkuran published in 1996 , &quot; all the women &apos;s minds are confused &quot; was adapted for theatre with the same name by the aysa production theatre .
selen uçer directs the play in which deniz çakır , zeynep kankonde , i̇pek türktan kaynak , kadir çermik and şebnem sönmez play a part .
uçer , whose plays &quot; poz &quot; and &quot; kuru sıkı &quot; are still ongoing , had her first experience of script writing and directing in the play , which questions the confusion in women &apos;s minds .
the play was introduced to an audience in the trump performance centre last week .
the play opens with a radio play .
a voice in the dark , taking us back to past years ...
then the curtain goes up .
a woman , who is sitting on a window ledge , is on the verge of jumping .
who she is and why she is trying to commit suicide are understood after the intervention of the next @-@ door neighbours .
she left a letter
&quot; ebru uysal , &quot; played by deniz çakır , is a popular writer .
she was left by her husband , but this is not the only reason .
there are some things that have accumulated inside her .
she was brought to this moment because of the fact that she did not enjoy paternal love , her childhood was spent in loneliness , and the fact that she thinks that she is not understood .
she decided to commit suicide , left a letter behind , but she cannot jump from the window .
because &quot; aysel &quot; ( zeynep kankonde ) , the prattling , gullible cleaner and next @-@ door neighbour , and &quot; perran &quot; ( şebnem sönmez ) , the mysterious woman in the opposite flat , draw her into conversation .
they approach the situation as if it were a normal , ordinary situation .
the woman becomes more stressed ; she could not concentrate and jump .
when the famous singer &quot; meltem kaya &quot; ( i̇pek türktan kaynak ) , who is having her home cleaned , joins the conversation between the three , the situation turns into a clamour of voices .
approaching the situation with her naive and sincere style , &quot; meltem &quot; cannot help but sing when she sees a crowd .
this interesting attempt at suicide takes on a different dimension with the appearance of real estate agent &quot; murat &quot; ( kadir çermik ) with a spare key .
the situation gets out of hand when the singer &quot; meltem &quot; gives very inaccurate information to the press .
the song &quot; sokak kızı &quot; by nazan öncel is also used in the play .
comedy of depression
directing on the stage for the first time , uçer was successful in ensuring the tempo and flow of the play .
zeynep kankonde and i̇pek türktan kaynak carry the burden of comedy in the play .
the exaggerated characters played by this duo succeed in making the audience laugh with both their mimics and lines .
while şebnem sönmez conveys her years of experience on the stage very well , deniz çakır delivers a persuasive performance in reflecting the depressed mood of &quot; ebru uysal . &quot;
making an indelible impression with his performance in tolga çelik &apos;s award @-@ winning film &quot; sarmaşık , &quot; kadir çermik successfully accompanies these four women .
defined as a comedy of depression , the one @-@ act play promises to make you laugh without confusing the mind .
here is what stayed in my mind from these beautiful words mostly coming from the mouth of &quot; perran , &quot; played by şebnem sönmez : do not scribble hastily , they will read it ; do not live hastily , they will see you .
most children possibly thought of dying to punish their fathers and mothers , and they somehow ended up crying at the thought .
the woman is hanging in the air like an unrealised joke .
the woman searches for a funny story that she has always forgotten a part of .
in fact , every story begins with a kind of being abandonment .
i should put my hands into my pocket , i cannot stand anything without pockets .
people do not know where to put their hands .
since we do not know it , our hands multiply .
people badmouth what they do not know ; they fabricate and fabricate .
a misunderstanding becomes reality .
all the women &apos;s heads are confused because they are messed up by someone .
if you are not able to die , you have a chance to live .
&quot; drink kefir and live longer &quot;
it can be consumed safely at any age
expressing that one of the nutrients that can be consumed safely by everyone of every age is kefir , a miraculous nutrient which is more beneficial than its main base of milk and whose health benefits are completely uncountable , the specialist dietician pınar kural enç said that , &quot; it is more nutritious than yoghurt because it includes protein , basic minerals and vitamin b. &quot;
it is rich in vitamin b1 , b12 and k .
thanks to its calcium and magnesium content , it creates the basis for a healthy nervous system .
it is also a good source of phosphorous .
in addition , having the feature of feeling full , kefir does not make you gain weight .
she said , &quot; its nutritional value is high and it is a digestible drink . &quot;
cure @-@ all
explaining that children , the elderly , expectant mothers and women entering the period of menopause can consume kefir without hesitation , the specialist dietician pınar kural enç said , &quot; kefir is originally a local drink made in the caucasus . &quot;
however it started to become famous around the world .
being the secret of youthfulness and an elixir for a long an healthy life , kefir cures nearly all conditions .
kefir is one of the most natural ways to protect babies from metabolic illnesses .
intestine @-@ friendly
this unique beverage , containing countless benefits , is intestine @-@ friendly .
there are around 1.5 @-@ 2 kilos of bacteria and fungus in our intestines .
micro @-@ organisms in the digestive system are divided into two groups : beneficial and detrimental ones .
beneficial micro @-@ organisms are called &quot; probiotic micro @-@ organisms . &quot;
the activities of probiotics have an important effect as much as our liver , and if they are consumed sufficiently they prevent detrimental micro @-@ organisms in the intestines from sticking and spreading to the intestinal wall .
impairment of the balance of healthy micro @-@ organisms in the intestine causes disease .
the health of the digestive tract should be protected through proper nourishment .
to do this , we should certainly consume a sufficient amount of probiotics .
it resolves all these problems found in the intestine
kefir is the most effective probiotic inclusive nutrient and the beneficial bacteria inside of it has a great effect in the strengthening of the intestinal system .
it enables the good bacteria and fungus in the intestines to reproduce healthily and to benefit us .
with regular use of kefir , the intestines will function , intestinal disorders will be resolved , bloating will be reduced , and healthier digestion will be obtained .
a healthy digestive system means a healthy and disease @-@ free body .
she said , &quot; kefir also cures loss of appetite , insomnia , upper respiratory tract infections and allergies , and will help babies to absorb vitamins and minerals from foods more efficiently , so it undertakes an important role in the nutrition of babies . &quot;

brought in as head of the red @-@ navy blues instead of korkmaz , hakan kutlu remained as head of the team , which he had managed before , for only one day .

putin eats his words
while russia is preparing to recognise the status of &quot; able to do business with russia &quot; for turkish companies if it cannot replace the services offered by turkey , the head of the russian tour operators union stated , &quot; russian citizens do not give up on turkey . &quot;
calculating that cutting current economic ties with turkey will bring additional costs to russia , the ministry of economic development for russia prepared a new &quot; exceptional cases &quot; bill for the russian government regarding turkey .
according to the proposal , published in the russian federal regulation , giving permission to turkish companies and firms is allowed when it becomes necessary even in the area of sanctions .
according to the proposal , goods and services from turkish companies and firms will be used in cases where it is impossible to provide them from sources other than turkey and domestic production in russia brings serious additional costs .
the committee formed within the ministry of economic development for russia with other related ministries will determine which services and goods of turkish origin will be included in this category .
therefore , officials will select and decide which turkish companies will be able to work with russia .
moreover , according to this document , state organizations and private companies in russia will have to prove that there is no russian equivalent for the business they will do with turkish partners .
in the case that the proposal is approved by the russian government and takes effect , the preferred turkish companies will be registered in russia .
the russian tour operators union expressed that russian citizens have not given up on turkey in the explanation it made yesterday .
the explanation includes the following : &quot; in spite of the ban on the sale of tours and the advice of the ministry of foreign affairs of russia to not go to turkey , our citizens have started to search for ways to organize their holiday by themselves . &quot;
the number of the posts titled &quot; the most practical and the cheapest way to take a holiday in turkey &quot; keeps snowballing in social media on the internet .
the most widespread advice is to make online hotel reservations and to fly with turkish airlines .
the russian prime minister dmitry medvedev defined the oil price falling under 30 dollars as a &quot; dramatical development &quot; from russia &apos;s viewpoint .
medvedev said , &quot; nobody thought that petroleum would fall under 30 dollars and it was also a big surprise for our government . &quot;
he said , &quot; at this rate , it seems impossible to implement the budget as is now . &quot;
we passed the last month of 2015 .
after the shot @-@ down plane crisis , russian president putin announces that economic sanctions will be intensified .
in those days , our businessmen and our turkish airlines staff suffered a lot , trying to go to russia in the usual way .
obstacles are set for turkish goods at customs , and they are subjected to unthinkable checks .
1 month , not much , passes from then till now , and nerdun hacıoğlu reports from moscow yesterday .
one way or another , sanctions are being eased one by one .
all right , but why ?
the reason is simple .
it is because the closing of border crossings with the methods of a century ago and efforts to convert a political fight into an economic fight are no longer effective in an era when the economy has become so globalised .
look , we are continuing to write news about how the economic embargo implemented against iran for many years was flouted .
russia and turkey are countries that seem to have many allies but actually don &apos;t have so many , and they are dependent upon each other .
it is not technically possible to separate the two countries in one night , connected through their businessmen , tourists , entrepreneurs and customers .
if you close the doors , the people of these two countries will enter each other &apos;s countries from the chimney .
the most correct way is to have political discussion and to make terms at the table before the sanctions create new reza zarrabs ( rıza sarraf ) .
without involving the economics ...

making a speech in a conference he participated in at the hague , koenders stated that assad is responsible for the refugee influx .
indicating that it is not possible to bring peace to syria as long as assad is in power , koenders stated the following :
assad should be tried in the icc in the hague .
someone with so many people &apos;s blood on his hands should be held accountable before the court .
in addition to this , assad is solely responsible for the refugee influx we are now facing .
however , i am aware of the fact that assad will not leave his post in the near future .
this matter should be talked about first and there is a need for russia &apos;s help within this context .

lack of scots title race bores dutch - de boer

de boer , currently an ambassador for ajax , said : &quot; in holland , they don &apos;t show highlights of the celtic games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because rangers aren &apos;t there .
people here don &apos;t only talk about rangers coming back .
they talk about the old firm .

sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

why i &apos;m a witness at an execution in oklahoma
later today , barring a late legal intervention , i will watch a man being put to death .
if it happens , and i hope it won &apos;t , i will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at oklahoma state penitentiary as richard glossip is executed by lethal injection .
he has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first made back in january , via his best friend , and though i was shocked , i agreed .
as the day approaches , i &apos;ve come to dread it .
so why do it ?
i agreed because i thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
true , journalists are permitted to watch executions in america and because there are often more applications than seats available , a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately .
i cannot do that .
i will be sitting alongside richard glossip &apos;s closest friends , and i have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours .
i like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say i cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so i won &apos;t be allowed a notebook and pen to record what i see .
i will just have to try to remember all the details .
one oklahoma journalist accused me on twitter of compromising my impartiality .
here &apos;s the lesson .
tell the inmate &apos;s story the way he likes it , get access .
i complained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have phrased it better , &quot; but still thinks i &apos;m wrong to do what i &apos;m doing .
richard glossip has taken issue with some of the things i &apos;ve said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and i wouldn &apos;t do it even if he did .
i &apos;ve told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
if he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti @-@ death penalty movement .
kim bellware , a reporter from the huffington post , will be alongside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of podcasts i &apos;ve made .
i won &apos;t go over all the details again here .
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent .
his actions after the murder of barry van treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact .
but i believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
i certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
i believe his execution is wrong .
and it &apos;s from this perspective that i will watch him die .
i cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
what you will get from me is what it &apos;s like to watch a man i like die an unnecessary death .
man coaxed from canning river after soggy police chase
the canning vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the canning river .
a perth man &apos;s bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow , muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to &quot; coax him gently back to shore . &quot;
canning vale police were called to a trespassing incident in beckenham on tuesday .
when they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the canning river .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; he was standing in the water saying &apos; i &apos;m not getting out , &apos; come and get me &apos; , &quot; senior sergeant shandell castledine said .
constable lachlan perhavec wasn &apos;t too keen on getting his uniform wet , so he employed a safer tactic - &quot; good police negotiation . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try and escape , &quot; senior sergeant castledine said .

peter moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
peter moody has alleged racing victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
he took aim at stewards and racing victoria &apos;s integrity department , alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of lady tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on wednesday .
moody told fairfax media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to lidari &apos;s positive swab to cobalt , which he can not explain .
he had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn &apos;t want it &quot; to look like sour grapes . &quot;
&quot; i wasn &apos;t going to say anything about that and i have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once , &quot; moody said .
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and i will have to live with what i said .
i will go home tonight and sleep well .
i want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that i am trying my best for them .
when they start to think i &apos;m not that &apos;s when i shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
i would then have to consider what i do with my licence .
earlier , moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighteen months ago terry bailey , dayle brown and dr brian stewart sat in a room with a man - who i will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what i was doing within my stables , &quot; moody said on racing.com .
they obviously believe i &apos;m a cheat .
if that &apos;s the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they &apos;ve been incompetent in trying to catch me .
robert roulston , former chairman of rvl , david moodie , current chairman of rvl , and bernard saundry , current ceo of rvl , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
should that make me think it &apos;s becoming personal ?
has rvl got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
am i bad for the industry ?
am i that bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think i am .
maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and i &apos;ve got no doubt what i &apos;m saying now might make them think about that .
but i &apos;ve got to the point now where i don &apos;t care and that saddens me .
that really saddens me .
i will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision .
i &apos;ve got the support of my family and i can walk away .
the trainer &apos;s frustration levels have built with the long @-@ running cobalt inquiry involving lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could &quot; throw my licence across the table . &quot;
moody , best known for preparing unbeaten champion black caviar , labelled the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
i &apos;ve got to accept full responsibility for that , &quot; he said .
one of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg .
it could have had it last night .
it could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
it had it on race day .
moody could be faced with a three @-@ month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice , which stewards have opened an inquiry into .
it is a joke .
people making these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , &quot; moody said .

police have arrested a man over a hit @-@ and @-@ run collision with a cyclist in cobram at the weekend .
the cyclist was airlifted to the royal melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the murray valley highway on saturday morning .

he is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident , failing to render assistance , and other traffic offences .
the cyclist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old cobram man , remains in hospital in a stable condition .
melbourne storm coach craig bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
melbourne storm coach craig bellamy has called criticism of his side &apos;s tackling as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by the nrl &apos;s two premiership favourites .
sydney roosters coach trent robinson said the referees allowed the storm to &quot; wrestle &quot; his side during the storm &apos;s upset win in the qualifying final in sydney on friday night .
brisbane broncos coach wayne bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the storm after his side &apos;s qualifying final win over north queensland cowboys on saturday night when he called that game a &quot; showcase &quot; of the rugby league and said the two queensland weren &apos;t &quot; too big &quot; into wrestling .
bellamy defended his side &apos;s tackling and said they just focused on their &quot; contact &quot; when tackling .
bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the storm beating them .
&quot; that keeps coming up - i didn &apos;t hear trent robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24 @-@ 2 , &quot; bellamy said on wednesday .
i can guarantee we haven &apos;t changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it &apos;s just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us .
trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it &apos;s funny how this always comes up at this time of year .
bellamy challenged bennett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; reminding his mentor that bennett &apos;s st george @-@ illawarra dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing &quot; boring &quot; football .
wayne is talking about exciting footy .
he made a point of comparing his game on saturday night with our one on friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; bellamy said .
i remember in 2010 st george was criticised a lot for being a boring team and wayne said he didn &apos;t give a rat &apos;s arse .
but now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy , especially his young halves with their speed .
that &apos;s the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
he made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like anthony milford and ben hunt so they can play like that .
to me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
six weeks ago they probably weren &apos;t thinking of us when they get to the big games .
bellamy also pointed out the storm and roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the broncos and cowboys game .
the broncos game was probably a good game , i haven &apos;t watched it yet but what was the score ? 16 @-@ 12 ?
our game it was 20 @-@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy ?
or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting ?
to me it &apos;s agendas .
if they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
the storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either north queensland cowboys or cronulla sharks in next saturday night &apos;s preliminary final at aami park with tickets on sale from next tuesday morning .
serbian man gets $ 200k bail on drug charge
a man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into queensland has been granted bail on a $ 200,000 surety .
marko maksimovic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht solay , which came from south america via vanuatu and docked at coomera in august .
maksimovic was observed meeting with his co @-@ accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the coomera roadhouse cafe , where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a toyota echo .
despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine , maksimovic &apos;s lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose .
supreme court judge peter flanagan was concerned maksimovic was a flight risk .
he has clear connections to serbia .
he travels to serbia often , &quot; he told the court on wednesday .
on the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying .
maksimovic &apos;s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
&quot; having read the affidavits of both those persons , it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $ 200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them , &quot; judge flanagan said .
but that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear , he warned .
maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his australian and serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm @-@ 6am curfew .
stevan hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
a paedophile used an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s phone to solicit child abuse images .
stevan hogg took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping hogg &apos;s hand .
she looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother .
police attended and saw the five pictures , then analysed computers found at the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children .
hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would &quot; lead paedophiles &quot; on the internet before &quot; pretending he was a police officer to scare them . &quot;
fiscal depute eilidh robertson told dundee sheriff court : &quot; he said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people .
he accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
he said he was doing it to lure them in .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
ms robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying .
she saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted .
the girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
hogg , 23 , of ward road , dundee , pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on june 14 last year , breaching bail on january 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on march 24 this year .
defence solicitor gregor sim asked that hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; to his crime .
sheriff alistair carmichael deferred sentence until october for social work background reports .
hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases .
he was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date .
zimbabwe &apos;s robert mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
mr mugabe , africa &apos;s oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium .
he was unhurt , but video of the fall went viral on social media .
the opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing mr mugabe during his address .
last month , they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on tuesday .
movement for democratic change ( mdc ) chief whip innocent gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt nr mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it &apos;s titled &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists after mr mugabe &apos;s speech .
it warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
the chief whip said the party , led by morgan tsvangirai , is &quot; worried &quot; about the threats to its politicians .
hewlett @-@ packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
hewlett @-@ packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost @-@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
hp is splitting into two listed companies later this year , separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster @-@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
the expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.7bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , hp said in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new hewlett packard enterprise , &quot; said meg whitman , the hp chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
&quot; hewlett packard enterprise will be smaller and more focused than hp is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , &quot; said whitman .
as a separate company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
hewlett packard enterprise will have more than $ 50bn in annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions &quot; to companies , according to a company statement .
it breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by stanford university graduates bill hewlett and dave packard to make electric equipment , and whose palo alto garage has been dubbed &quot; the birthplace of silicon valley . &quot;
hp has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
the move by hp , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest pc maker and one of the biggest us tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better .
arsenal captain mikel arteta says team @-@ mates must get behind injured jack wilshere ahead of dinamo zagreb tie
wenger has also stressed to wilshere that it is still only september and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by christmas .
that best @-@ case scenario already means that wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four england games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer &apos;s european championship is clearly uncertain .
the great shame of this latest problem is that wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not career @-@ threatening , &quot; said wenger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is nothing major .
this was just an accident .
it was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
that might be true from a purely medical perspective but , as wenger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason .
there is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
research by premier injuries ltd records 23 different wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 of arsenal &apos;s 157 league games during the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 @-@ 08 , they have been one of the two premier league clubs to lose most days through injury .
wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
&quot; sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , &quot; said wenger .
jack is young enough to get over that .
i hope his body stabilises , i am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
with arsenal beginning their champions league campaign on wednesday night against dinamo zagreb ahead of matches with chelsea on saturday and tottenham hotspur next wednesday , wenger is preparing to rotate his team .
héctor bellerín and aaron ramsey have not travelled to croatia , meaning mathieu debuchy and arteta are likely to start .
wenger may also begin with kieran gibbs and olivier giroud in place of nacho monreal and theo walcott .
&quot; i try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it , &quot; said wenger .
although arsenal are clear favourites to progress through group f , the maksimir stadium in zagreb is among europe &apos;s most intimidating .
dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own &quot; invincible &quot; campaign last season .
the stadium was shaken on tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the richter .
it was the 10th in zagreb this year .
wenger believes that arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season &apos;s champions league capitulation against monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first european cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said wenger .
it has never been done at arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , i am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dreamers .
friendsfest : the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20 @-@ 45 in the uk , and remains three times more common in males than females .
in a bid to address the problem , the campaign against living miserably ( calm ) announced 2015 as the year of the male , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of &quot; healthy mood &quot; friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
equally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising .
but of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
in this age of social @-@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health .
and as a billionaire video @-@ game creator explained recently , money really doesn &apos;t buy greater happiness .
the beauty of friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their personalities , which shone through the interaction as friends .
the humour of joey and chandler &apos;s frequent hugs , moments watching football on the comfy chairs , and ross &apos;s pining for rachel , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all relate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings .
as a samaritan worker explained to me : .... &quot; my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference . &quot;
often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
the old adage of &quot; getting on with it &quot; is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when i try and offer more long @-@ term coping mechanisms .
it highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
as much as my objective , outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation , the long @-@ term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
and so , if you attend comedy central &apos;s friendsfest this weekend , with the sets fully redesigned in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at central perk .
or , better still , if in starbucks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends is broadcasting on comedy central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for # friendsfest
di maria scores to help psg swat aside malmo
angel di maria celebrates with blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after scoring against malmo .
angel di maria scored on his champions league debut to help psg ease past swedish side malmo on tuesday .
here &apos;s the match report and reaction to the game .
angel di maria and edinson cavani were on target as paris saint @-@ germain began their champions league campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against malmo at the parc des princes on tuesday .
di maria scored less than four minutes into his champions league debut as a psg player to set the french champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when cavani headed home in the 61st minute .
with real madrid and shakhtar donetsk also in group a , paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a vintage display by laurent blanc &apos;s side with zlatan ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or away in the champions league , so to win 2 @-@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , &quot; said blanc .
it augurs well .
we wanted to win and we did , although i regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the paris team that had been held to a 2 @-@ 2 draw at home by bordeaux in ligue 1 at the weekend , but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by di maria .
the argentina winger was labelled as the man to take psg to the next level in europe when he was signed from manchester united last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto marco verratti &apos;s pass in behind the malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past johan wiland and into the far corner of the net .
however , if anyone then expected psg to romp to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
malmo , who beat celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick @-@ off and , with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in midfield , were stuffy opponents .
but , save for a nikola djurdjic shot that slid just wide of kevin trapp &apos;s far post in the 34th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , psg let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing , not least from ibrahimovic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by cavani just after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an ibrahimovic pass that di maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by wiland on 52 minutes .
the second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to cavani , the uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after ibrahimovic had flicked on a left @-@ wing cross from maxwell .
that ended any ideas that malmo had of coming back into the game , and only a superb stop by wiland from point @-@ blank range to deny david luiz kept the final score down before substitute ezequiel lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death .
malmo coach age hareide later admitted psg were a class above his side , the norwegian saying : &quot; our last champions league game was in december last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the swedish league which is not the same level .
the qualifiers are not enough .
hats off to paris .
it was a magnificent match from them .
glencore raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
swiss @-@ based mining giant glencore , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt @-@ slashing plan .
london @-@ listed glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as china &apos;s economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets .
the rights issue sent glencore &apos;s share price soaring to the top of the london stock market in early morning deals on wednesday .
shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the ftse 100 index , which opened 0.69 percent higher .
glencore had last week revealed the $ 2.5 @-@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .
the company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share , which marked a 2.4 @-@ percent discount to the closing price on tuesday .
it offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns over prolonged stalled chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .
white house confirms xi jinping &apos;s washington visit
chinese president xi jinping will make a state visit to the u.s. at the end of the month , the white house confirmed in a statement on tuesday .
the visit , xi &apos;s first official one to washington , will take place on sept . 25 and reciprocates president barack obama &apos;s trip to beijing last november , the statement said .
the u.s. president and first lady michelle obama will also host xi and his wife peng liyuan at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
&quot; president xi &apos;s visit will present an opportunity to expand u.s.-china cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mutual interest , while also enabling president obama and president xi to address areas of disagreement constructively , &quot; the statement added .
xi , whose visit was first announced in february , is expected to stop in seattle to meet several u.s. tech leaders on his way to washington , before going on to new york city for the u.n. general assembly on sept .
obama and xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues , including washington &apos;s concerns over china &apos;s alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the south china sea .
matt damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
matt damon confronted african @-@ american filmmaker effie brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during sunday night &apos;s episode of hbo &apos;s project greenlight , the seasoned actor cut brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project &apos;s chosen screenplay .
&quot; when we &apos;re talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , &quot; damon asserted .
shocked , brown reacted with offended disbelief , letting out &quot; hoo ! wow . okay , &quot; as the martian actor &apos;s comments settled in the air .
damon and brown were joined by fellow producers ben affleck and the farrelly brothers to discuss the show &apos;s finalists .
&quot; i would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they &apos;re going to treat the character of harmony , &quot; brown initially said .
the only black character who &apos;s a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp .
the dear white people producer pushed for finalists leo angelos and kristen brancaccio for the rights to direct the film ; damon retorted their directing could &quot; end up giving us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion aired , social media exploded in disapproval over damon &apos;s comments .
twitter user mrpooni expressed anger toward the clip writing , &quot; matt damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is so white it hurts . &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted .
damon &apos;s comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after teen michael brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the black lives matter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color .
in february , singer prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of album of the year at the grammy awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black lives , albums still matter .
more recently , leaders of the black lives matter movement released a statement in response to fox news personality elisabeth hasselbeck &apos;s question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; the black lives matter network is a love group , &quot; leaders said .
damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers , producers and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the catholic church &apos;s portrayal in the west .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the pope is unclear .
&apos;american ninja warrior &apos; crowns first champion
pro @-@ rock climber and busboy isaac caldiero became the first athlete to win american ninja warrior monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
the competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , two men , caldiero and cameraman geoff britten , made it to the final round .
the final task involved climbing a 75 @-@ foot rope in 30 seconds .
britten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first @-@ ever athlete to complete american ninja warrior &apos;s grueling stage 4 , however , caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
caldiero spoke with e ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
&quot; i mean it &apos;s amazing to think about , like i &apos;ve never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , &quot; isaac told e ! of his serious pay @-@ bump .
so to all of a sudden ... like i can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;s going to be like ... the future is unknown .
executive producer kent weed sat down with the hollywood reporter to discuss the finale and why , despite britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course , won &apos;t be awarded any prize money .
by the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one finisher , the one with the fastest time gets it , &quot; said weed .
as much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great gratification .
i don &apos;t think he harbors any ill will about it .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he &apos;s done .
he &apos;s received tons of accolades from fans .
he &apos;s such a great guy , and a family man .
he &apos;s a hero to his kids and his wife .
geoff said to me , &quot; if i was going to be beat by someone , i &apos;m glad it &apos;s isaac . &quot;
and i think isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed .
america ninja warrior was renewed for an eighth season , which will begin filming in spring 2016 .
detroit tigers tiptoe past minnesota twins
minneapolis -- the second half the season hasn &apos;t been a lot of fun for the detroit tigers .
once one of the best teams in baseball , the tigers are now in last place in the american league central .
reducing to being a spoiler , the tigers played the part perfectly tuesday , beating the minnesota twins 5 @-@ 4 at target field .
the twins squandered a chance to climb to within one @-@ half game of the houston astros for the second american league wild @-@ card spot .
for detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three @-@ letter f @-@ word that has been so elusive over much of the season &apos;s second half .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it happens , &quot; tigers manager brad ausmus said .
tigers pitcher alfredo simon made his early offensive support hold up , as detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) pitched 6 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs .
it was only his third quality start in his past nine outings .
&quot; i just want to finish strong this year , &quot; simon said .
it &apos;s hard for the bullpen to throw every game , and that &apos;s why i want to go deep into the game .
tigers designated hitter victor martinez had three hits and drove in two runs , his first rbis since mid @-@ august .
it was martinez &apos;s first three @-@ hit night since he had four hits against the seattle mariners on july 6 .
&quot; he swung the bat well , &quot; ausmus said .
he looked good in ( batting practice ) , looked noticeably better in bp , and he carried it right into the game .
trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning , the twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center fielder byron buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
right fielder aaron hicks reached on a bunt single , and simon got second baseman brian dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left @-@ hander blaine hardy .
hardy walked mauer , the only man he faced , ahead of rookie designated hitter miguel sano , who ripped a two @-@ run single to left off right @-@ hander drew verhagen .
with a pair of runners on and the tying run at second , verhagen got third baseman trevor plouffe to ground into a double play .
it was the major @-@ league @-@ leading 27th time this season that plouffe hit into a dp .
after detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , mauer ripped an rbi double to the gap against tigers closer bruce rondon to make it 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ hander struck out sano on three pitches for his fifth save .
detroit took advantage of a rusty phil hughes in the early going .
the tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right @-@ hander , who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation .
&quot; obviously not the start i &apos;d like to have , &quot; hughes said , &quot; but i felt more comfortable as i went along and felt i was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . &quot;
after getting the leadoff batter in the first , hushes gave up a single to second baseman ian kinsler .
a two @-@ out walk to right fielder j.d. martinez brought up victor martinez , who singled up the middle for the first run of the game .
victor martinez snapped his 0 @-@ for @-@ 21 streak with runners in scoring position .
third baseman nick castellanos followed with a single to right , scoring another run , but victor martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
the tigers added on in the second , getting a one @-@ out double from catcher james mccann and a two @-@ out single by center fielder anthony gose to make it 3 @-@ 0 .

xi urges to open economy wider to world
the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , president xi jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on tuesday .
&quot; china should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve opening @-@ up policies , &quot; he said , addressing the 16th meeting of the central leading group for deepening overall reform .
promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality , and provide new room for economic growth , xi said .
the leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access , relaxation of border @-@ control policies , encouraging state @-@ owned enterprises ( soe ) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system .
according to the statement , a negative list , identifying sectors and businesses that are off @-@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
the system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
the move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources , ensuring a law @-@ based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
the government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said china will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in a bid to open up state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the lawful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement .
in addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or &quot; green card , &quot; by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process .
guaranteeing lawyers &apos; right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting was also attended by premier li keqiang , and senior leaders liu yunshan and zhang gaoli , according to a statement released after the meeting .
mini @-@ bags are the height of fashion - zaman newspaper saturday supplement
the subject eventually returned to bags in the world of fashion .
the recent outstanding trend is those miniatures ...
it is possible to say that the small bags that are placed next to the big ones draw attention .
it is said that small is beautiful .
this point of view also applies to bags .
even though we didn &apos;t tire of walking the streets with almost @-@ suitcase @-@ sized bags , the tide has started to turn and bags are inclined to be smaller .
small bags already existed but they appeared before us in minimised versions of big shoulder bags .
only your telephone , credit card and keys fit inside these tiny bags .
starting with céline and hermès , the trend spread with prada .
transforming this bag mania into an interest for mini @-@ bags has affected the newly emerging models .
loewe presented the fun bags it created in two sizes .
among the bags , in the shape of pandas , polar bears and elephants , the most outstanding ones are the elephant @-@ shaped ones .
presented by luxury brands with phenomenal names , mini versions of the big bags seem to attract red @-@ carpet celebrities most .
one of the most popular is the &quot; birkin &quot; bag hermès created as a dedication to jane birkin .
even though jane birkin said that she does not want her name to be remembered with a bag , she is now imprinted in the memory in this way .
fashion weeks led to the popularization of the mini @-@ bag trend .
consequently , mini @-@ bags have been prominent on the podium .
since they are very small , it is not really possible to wear them on your arm .
they can be worn across the body with their long straps .
however , we saw these straps tangled around the wrists of the models on the podium .
fendi is one of those taking the mini @-@ bag theme one step forward .
it has some advice for those who cannot fit into mini @-@ bags but cannot abandon them either .
mini @-@ bags as a friend of big bags .
how ?
by transforming the mini @-@ bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to bigger ones .
featured on the podiums , this presentation has taken to the streets very quickly .
let &apos;s see what else we will see !
denim changes skin
turkey is on a level that can compete with world brands in terms of denim .
the experience gained in production has been enriched with design .
loft is one of them .
we now see that black designs , having been few in the past , take their place on the shelves every season .
denim found its closest friend in a season when black colours are on the rise .
leather pieces and designs with leather details come to the forefront as the rebellious friend of denim .
generally , zippered short designs called &quot; motorbike &quot; are most prominent .
the strong mood of leather complete with black pieces ; chiffon long blouses and bright sweatshirts , provides a casual and chic appearance .
in the past , young people wore denim and wanted to be lost in the crowd .
it was thought that it would save the day .
nowadays , young people want to wear designs that are comfortable and emphasise their style at the same time .
within this perspective , it can be said that loft correctly understood its target group with their collections and accessories it designed
a small step for banksy , a giant step for the &quot; global &quot;
bringing together the works of mysterious street artist banksy , the world première of the collection &quot; the art of banksy &quot; was held in istanbul .
a product of 15 years of work from the artist and gathering the originals of 85 works for the first time , the exhibition is the first in the global karaköy building .
the first exhibition by the mysterious street artist banksy in istanbul opened yesterday in the global karaköy ( rıhtım street ) .
the world famous artist , who conceals his identity and uses an alias , was not present at the exhibition opening of course .
we also don &apos;t know if he came to istanbul or not .
however , banksy is not aware of this exhibition according to steve lazaridas , curator of the exhibition .
it is not necessary to receive permission from him .
the reason is that old friends banksy and lazaridas parted company with each other after 12 years .
the exhibited works were partly collected from lazaridas and collectors .
however , there are issues that banksy fans are curious about .
what would banksy think about the exhibition &quot; the art of banksy &quot; which brings together 85 of his works ?
for example , what would he think of entering the exhibition with a ticket ( 35 tl ) ? what would he say if he saw the 800 square metre gallery space with a small store created at the end ?
would he raise his voice against the fact that cloth bags , wallets and necklaces are printed with works of his such as red balloon girl , maid , smile now , which draws attention to the wounds of the world ?
banksy followers feel disappointed by the turning of an exhibition of an artist who conceals his identity and has an anarchist soul into such consumer goods .
this is certainly not the style of banksy .
nevertheless , get your limited availability tickets before they are sold out !
small for banksy but giant for the globalised world , the exhibition &quot; the art of banksy &quot; can be seen until april .
they are despicable and cruel .
let them dig ditches .
president recep tayyip erdoğan continued his reaction against the academics that signed the declaration .
erdoğan said , &quot; they are cruel , they are despicable . &quot;
because those who stand by the oppressors are oppressors .
he said , &quot; since they stand by those who slaughtered , they committed the same offence . &quot;
laying flowers at the scene of the explosion in sultanahmet , recep tayyip erdoğan said , &quot; i shared our grief both with the german president and german chancellor because of the fact that 10 of our german friends were killed during this action in sultanahmet square that is full of history and civilization , and simply a square of peace - particularly in a place like this , near to the german fountain . &quot;
firstly i would like to convey my condolences to the german people , especially to the families of the victims .
he said , &quot; our fight against terrorism will continue with determination . &quot;
continuing his reaction towards the academics who signed the declaration , erdoğan stated the following : &quot; i condemn again and strongly condemn in particular the academics who put their signature under this slaughter by publishing a &quot; pitch @-@ black &quot; declaration even in the face of all these terrorist incidents . &quot;
i want our nation to understand much more closely who is who ; in other words , having a title of professor , assistant professor does not make a person literate .
they are completely dark people .
they are cruel , they are despicable .
since they stand by those who slaughtered , they also committed the same offence .
what do these dark academics think about those babies , 3 @-@ year old mevlüde who died a martyr with her father in the incident that occurred in çınar ?
how can they allow their conscience to stand by her killers ?
i am inviting all the judicial authorities , university senates to do their duty for these acts against our constitution and laws .
yesterday , i said that all the necessary steps should be taken rapidly .
let them do whatever they do out there .
if they want to do politics , let them do politics in parliament .
if they cannot do it in parliament , let them go and dig ditches or go to the mountains .
i am saying it clearly and explicitly .

&quot; while i was searching for two wrestler children , i found 26 people &quot;
the second documentary from mete gümürhan , &quot; young wrestler , &quot; 66th .
it became the first turkish documentary to be selected in the &quot; generation kplus &quot; section of the berlin film festival ( february 11 @-@ 21 ) .
originally from edirne but with a production company in the netherlands , gümürhan talked about how and why he shot the documentary which he completed in the summer of 2014 .
telling the story of six students in a boarding school from amasya who aimed at becoming the world champion in the field of wrestling , the documentary &quot; young wrestlers &quot; will compete in the &quot; generation kplus &quot; section of the berlin film festival .
being the first made @-@ in @-@ turkey documentary to be selected in this section , young wrestlers is one of the candidates for the crystal bear award .
mete gümürhan is originally from edirne even though he was born and raised in the netherlands .
he listened to stories about grease wrestling from his grandfather and watched competitions in turkey , where he came during the summer when he was a child .
&quot; there are not only political problems in turkey . &quot;
i wanted to tell the world what is going on in anatolia other than that .
with the idea , &quot; wrestling , one of our ancestor sports , is not well known , &quot; for example , he brought together 6 directors and wanted to create a documentary project .
this project remained inconclusive but news in a magazine he read on a plane opened the door to another project for gümürhan .
&quot; we stayed in a sugar factory &quot;
tracing the article that talked about two little wrestler brothers aged 10 @-@ 11 , mete gümürhan went so samsun , where their family lives .
the father of the children did not give permission to shoot a documentary .
gümürhan talked about how he overcame this challenge as follows : &quot; i thought about what i could do all day long . &quot;
&quot; because the support of the ministry of culture might be withdrawn . &quot;
the father mentioned a boarding school in amasya , where the children would go .
i thought of going there .
while i was searching for two children , i found 26 children with an interest in wrestling .
we started shooting preparations and finalized the authorization .
we did not even have a place to stay .
&quot; we stayed in the dormitory of a sugar factory . &quot;
language was the biggest challenge posed for the director by the documentary , the shooting of which was completed in 3 weeks .
stating that three different languages were spoken on the set of the film in which a foreign director of cinematography and a soundman worked , gümürhan said , &quot; i did not know what i would come across during the shoot . &quot;
he says , &quot; they did not know turkish either . &quot;
young wrestlers focuses on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers .
baran , who was brought up by his grandfather and had a weight problem , harun , who could not participate in training because he broke his arm , beytullah , who is ambitious but has some health problems , ümit , who is the pretty boy of the school , the youngest champion ahmet and muhammed , who holds the group together ...
mete gümürhan says of working with the children as follows : &quot; i let them be completely natural . &quot;
i tried to use only muhammed everywhere .
i shot the training for the first one and a half weeks .
i wanted that the children act as if there were no camera .
&quot; fortunately they quickly adapted . &quot;
it was a surprise to be selected for berlin
stating that he did not expect young wrestlers to be selected for the berlin film festival , mete gümürhan said , &quot; we were ready , but it was a surprise for us to be selected for berlin . &quot;
young wrestlers is not a sports documentary , it is a production that narrates the struggle of the children and a slice of their life .
he says , &quot; i wanted to highlight the struggle of children with family problems to find an identity and their story of coping with their problems . &quot;
support from the world of art for the academics
the storm that broke out after the declaration of &quot; the initiative of academics for peace , &quot; went so far that investigations were opened against the academics and they were taken into custody yesterday ; but at the same time , there are also statements of support arriving one after another .
the first support came from the literati , among whom there are many famous people .
film makers expressed their support the day before yesterday , and theatre actors did so yesterday .
in the explanation made with the signatures of 138 theatre actors , it was stated , &quot; we , as artists working in the field of theatre and stage @-@ performance , stand by this honourable meeting of academics making a call for peace ; and we state that we stand by the freedom of expression , equality , right to life and unconditional peace . &quot;
it was said , &quot; we add our voice to the discussion and peace calls from the academics with all our heart and conscience . &quot;
more than 400 film makers including deniz türkali , atilla özdemiroğlu , nadir sarıbacak , özcan alper , serra yılmaz , onur ünlü , yeşim ustaoğlu , pelin esmer , tolga karaçelik stated that , &quot; we stand by free thought and art . &quot;
without using but , however and if : &quot; we won &apos;t take part in this crime ! &quot;
they supported the academics by saying , &quot; we stand by the initiative of the academics for peace . &quot;
the screenwriters association ( si̇yad ) also made a statement and said , &quot; we stand by the academics , who were made the target of a lynching campaign . &quot;
the initiative of academics for peace called for peace and discussion from the government with simultaneous statements in ankara and istanbul on january 11 ; and it published a declaration under the title , &quot; we are not party to this crime . &quot;
in addition to the 1128 academics from 89 universities , the text was signed by thinkers such as noam chomsky , david harvey , immanuel wallerstein , judith butler , and etienne balibar , who have worldwide fame through their theories and books .
president erdoğan and prime minister davutoğlu defined the declaration of the academics as &quot; support for terrorism &quot; and criticised it very harshly ; and erdoğan called on organizations to &quot; do what is needed . &quot;
after this call , some universities fired the academics and the prosecution office brought an ex @-@ officio prosecution .
many academics were taken into custody yesterday .
i am your fan , please help me !
hürrem sultan &apos;s red hair , beren &apos;s nose , justin &apos;s hair ...
trying to look like celebrities is considered normal to some extent but it is regarded as a psychological disorder after the point that it starts to completely affect your life .
&quot; celebrity worship syndrome , &quot; also known as &quot; the syndrome of worshipping famous people &quot; is a matter that has already become an academic issue around the world and is a newly spoken about issue in our country .
it can be considered normal to some extent that ladies run to the hair salons with photos of celebrities .
however , we should not forget the &quot; hürrem sultan &quot; year when all the youth walked around with red irish hair .
it was already reported that &quot; beren &apos;s nose &quot; led the way in plastic surgeries in 2015 .
the situation is not so very different on the part of men .
once upon a time , dressing like polat alemdar was a custom .
now a totally different trend prevails everywhere .
our surroundings are full of young boys that are copies of justin bieber .
it is at such an extent that the following quote of useless information was read thousands of times : &quot; firstly , when you go to the hairdresser , have your hair cut at the sides , in other words , the part over and around your ears up to the upper part of your head . &quot;
however , the sides should be short .
after the cutting process is over , you should shape your hair lightly with water .
after the shaping process , fix your hair with the help of spray .
&quot; it is necessary to shape it when it is wet to get justin hair . &quot;
all of these issues have already become academic subjects around the world , but they remind us of the newly spoken &quot; celebrity worship syndrome , &quot; in other words &quot; the syndrome of worshipping famous people . &quot;
fans of celebrities are considered as a &quot; bundle of love . &quot;
artists always pride themselves on their fan numbers and how their fans affect them .
luckily , psychology does not consider the condition so simply .
in particular , it is much discussed that adolescents make decisions about what they eat and drink , what they listen to , what they wear in accordance with celebrities .
excessive loyalty to people presented as unattainable , and taking them as role models is defined as a mental disorder .
senior psychologist sümeyye demir accepts that turkey falls behind in terms of studies into this field .
however she does not fail to notice the fact that families are gradually becoming conscious : &quot; one of the basic issues in the science of psychology is people being at peace with themselves and finding peace in their identities . &quot;
in the past , it was not taken seriously if children filled their rooms with posters and played the role of someone .
this situation is now changing .
their parents feel the need to intervene in the situation .
&quot; passionate loyalty to someone is a sign of the fact that something has gone wrong in the teen &apos;s life . &quot;
fans jumping onto the emotional speed train
interest in celebrity is safe in moderation .
demir advises to be careful of symptoms such as not wanting them to marry , envying their spouses and preferring their clothing styles .
as the name implies , we are talking about famous people .
being curious about them and having an interest in their life is considered normal to some extent .
however , young people overstepping the limits are prevalent according to the senior psychologist : &quot; when there is no one in the family or the surroundings to serve as a model for virtues and good behaviour , this gap is certainly filled . &quot;
good examples do not always emerge .
&quot; children also copy the negative things . &quot;
when we consult her about how we should approach them , sümeyye demir starts by reminding us that the syndrome of celebrity worship is seen mostly in adolescence .
the problem is more easily overcome once it is taken into consideration that adolescents may be insecure .
on one hand , we are complaining about the limitations of family and on the other hand we are facing young people expecting support and affection from them : &quot; we are obliged to take into consideration their emotional ups and downs . &quot;
new research put forward that they are forced by the changes occurring in their brains .
&quot; it should be taken naturally if an adolescent , jumping onto the emotional speed train , is attached to someone ; and they should be approached delicately . &quot;
it is possible to change behaviour
senior psychologist sümeyye demir , reminds us of the duties falling into the share of parents to overcome celebrity worship syndrome :
identify their emotional problem and be sure that you are calm before bringing up the issue .
never let them suppress their emotions .
express your respect for their adoration in order to encourage freedom .
instead of teaching them by reprimanding , serve as a good model for them , discuss the people that can be a role model to them .
try to talk together about the roles of celebrities in our daily life .
it would be helpful to read books about the real world of celebrities together .
change your communication approach to the form of adult to adult .
do not forget the fact that addiction and motivation use the brain in the same way .
tell your child that errors are opportunities for change , and accept them as they are .
get the support of specialists dealing with being a fan .
those who get angry and those who admire both worship
at the base of the syndrome of celebrity worship there is a need to appeal and get help from someone .
it is in fact a unpreventable love , a call for help .
but unfortunately it is not perceived like this .
furthermore , this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to narrow it down to a country or a continent .
dr. recai yahyaoğlu draws attention to the fact that there are certain people that occupy the television in every country .
the syndrome manifests itself mostly in an attachment to the celebrities : &quot; they are extraordinary . &quot;
most people do not have their opportunities .
those who have do not live their life by acting like them .
it is because they do not embrace this life or they do not dare to do it .
&quot; however , both those who do not have the opportunities , and those who have the opportunities but do not live like them continue to watch them angrily . &quot;
there is no difference between those who covet them and those who watch them bursting with anger .
both admire them inwardly .
they earn money without trouble , they are in magazines daily .
even knowing this is enough to increase their admiration .
other advice from the senior psychologist sümeyye demir is to question the reality of these lives .
we should not fail to notice that artificial lives are being talked about .
support from the surrounding people steps in for the person who feels passionately about celebrity .
however , people insist on rejecting the fact that the celebrities they admire also have problems like them .

should i undergo a cholecystostomy ? - family @-@ health news - zaman newspaper
dr. fevzi özgönül answers the questions in his column in the meydan newspaper ..
i have gallstones , i have stomach ache when i get up every morning and after meals ; and i visit the toilet 2 times or more everyday .
could it prevent me from losing weight ?
i have now started to use alkaline , but my appetite for meals hasn &apos;t diminished , i cannot lose any weight .
it has been the same since my childhood .
what should i do ?
in your opinion , should i undergo a cholecystostomy ?
answer : most of the time , an infection accompanies gallstones .
this complaint of stomach aches , occurring soon after meals , is a sign of the fact that your gallbladder tightens when you eat and you spill the infected gall into the intestines .
disturbed by the infected gall , the intestines try to quickly expel this gall .
this is why you visit the toilet frequently .
since you visit the toilet frequently and what you eat is expelled without being digested , losing weight becomes slower .
in my opinion , you should have this condition treated .
if you go to a gastroenterologist and the condition is detected as i said , you can be free from this condition by using antibiotics .
however , you may eventually have to undergo a cholecystostomy .
alkaline probiotics may decrease your symptons but it does not cure them .
i advise you to use alkaline probiotics anyway .
because this probiotic powder is the biggest help in losing weight .
i eat too much under stress
dear sir , i eat continuously when i am stressed and angry ; and i gain weight .
how can i cope with this ?
answer : an excessive appetite for food means in fact that your energy needs are not met .
the reason for this may be eating less or skipping morning meals and lunches .
another reason is your failure to digest the food you eat .
to do this , your digestive system should work healthily .
if you do not have a problem such as an ulcer , reflux or similar problems , the easiest way is to use a good probiotic medicine .
you will greatly feel its benefits .
i cannot gain weight , doctors do not know the reason
generally there is information about losing weight in your column .
all of it seems logical to me too , but my situation is a little bit different .
somehow i cannot gain weight .
the most important thing is i do not know why .
doctors do not say anything either .
answer : the techniques we apply are not intended for losing weight , but also regaining the physiological functions of the body and turning it into its ideal size .
being overweight and being too thin are the same kinds of disorder .
failure to lose weight when fat and failure to gain weight when slim are cured with the same technique .
you lose weight more when you eat sweets and pastries .
i imagine you might have understood this by now .
it is also possible for you to be stimulated with carboxy therapy and gain weight through a healthy diet .
in other words , you became distant from your ideal body by losing weight .

children who feel worthless become stuck in &quot; hatred &quot;
there are some innate emotions in people &apos;s world of emotion .
fear , sadness , happiness , astonishment , anger , anxiety ...
however , some emotions like hatred , holding a grudge and revenge emerge in children gradually and as a result of the wrong behaviour .
everybody needs to be an individual including during their childhood .
in other words , they desire that their parents and social circle respect their decisions , their opinion is asked in matters related to them , and they are made to feel valued .
enabling them to create the base on which to construct a healthy personality .
for example , behaviour such as making decisions in matters relating to the child ( what they wear , what they eat ) instead of the child , insisting on your truth without considering the wishes of the child ( sending a child to a music course even though they want to go to a football course ) means not respecting the personality of the child .
when their individuality and being are not respected , children lose the freedom of &quot; being themselves &quot; and their defence mechanism reveals emotions of anger and hatred in order to protect themselves .
stating that , &quot; the reason is that anger and hatred are in fact just opposites of acceptance , &quot; psychologist hilal arslan says that children do not accept what is done to them by showing hate and they try to say to both themselves and the people around them that they are precious .
saying that it is good for their personality development that children do not accept the situation and react to it , the senior psychologist said , &quot; the hatred here means i am also here , it serves the children &apos;s aim to protect their self @-@ respect . &quot;
she says , &quot; if children are allowed to be individuals , the hatred will be eliminated . &quot;
children try to protect their self by resorting to anger and hatred
saying that if children are exposed to the verbal and emotional violence of their parents and surroundings , it will cause negative emotions in children in a time that they are at a young age and are both physically and spiritually most vulnerable , arslan states that negligence will make the child feel that their existence is not noticed and they are invisible .
arslan continues with the following : &quot; maybe sometimes we can fail to meet the emotional needs ( not stroking their hair , not hugging and kissing them , not caring about their school or other needs ) , and sometimes we can fail to meet also their physical needs ( eating , drinking , shelter , school needs etc . ) . &quot;
this is a growing attitude that opens the doors to anger and hatred .
for emotional and verbal violence , there is behaviour like humiliation , insulting , belittling , scolding , unnecessary and heavy punishment , making them feel worthless and yelling .
since this behaviour is towards the personality of the child , it has a deep effect .
&quot; children who accept it , lose their self @-@ respect and spend their lives struggling with the feeling that they are worthless , unworthy of being loved and inadequate , or they will protect themselves by resorting to anger and hatred . &quot;
