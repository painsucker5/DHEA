vacant san francisco , 28 , found dead at san francisco shopping mall
a recently moved to san francisco , the 28 @-@ year @-@ old vaccine was found dead this week in the foot of a local shopping mall .
however , the victim &apos;s brother , his brother , said he was not aware that it would be someone to harm him . in the end , he was doing a good job for him , he added .
the san francisco forensic medical association said wednesday morning that the body , found at the westfield shopping centre , was found to belong to frank galicia , 28 .
the san francisco police directorate said the cause of murder was determined and that research is still ongoing .
his brother , louis galicia , a brother of the victim , told kgo francisco &apos;s abc station at san francisco that frank , previously working as mini @-@ chief of the motor in boston , started work as head of the san francisco sons and daughak department , starting six months ago .
sons &amp; daughters said the death was &quot; turning into strife and was very sad . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team of people who work as a hard family , and he will be very pretty numbered , &quot; he said .
we would like to state that at this difficult time that we are not alone for the family and that we have had them .
frank was initially housed in hostels , according to louis galicia . &quot; finally , things were well going to do for him , &quot; he said .
louis galicia told kgo &quot; he had had had had a flat and he had come out with a daughter . &quot;
louis galicia said he does not think there could be a person who would like to harm his younger brother .
he was a heart , a spectacular man .
the way to build ties with the family was always to prepare us with a sign , to prepare us a meal , and to make a meal for us , &quot; he said .
he weren &apos;t thrilled by his insignia .
my wife adjusted to all situations .
&quot; while everything else in the world was embarrassed , he was so nonexistent every day , &quot; he said .

aspiring doctors strike : calls for new labour slowing
representatives of the assistants in asia have asked them to allow their trade @-@ offs to slow down the dispute over a new contract .
the committee of doctors in britain ( bma ) called on the council to support further business slowing , starting in early september .
the jdc said the ministers could not address concerns over the charter .
serbian doctors and medical students voted in favour of the contract with bma .
this was rejected by 58 % of the eligible members .
in an article published on thursday night in twitter , jdc head ellen mccourt said the government was &quot; silent &quot; about the problems caused by the rejection of the contract .
&quot; in this light , the jdc steering board voted in favour of the proposed new contract as whole and called for a restart of formal talks on concerns , &quot; he said .
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the jdc administration sent an official request to allow the bma board to allow a programme to increase business slowing starting in early september .
the move sparked a six @-@ strike that included the first artillery interruption in the nhs history this year .
ashann malawana , an assistant professor at bma , resigned after having voted against the contract requirements proposed by bma .
it was a good agreement that needs to be accepted by members of the bma during the meetings of 5,000 asian doctors and medical students before they cast their ballots , he said .
following the vote , health minister jeremy hunt said the contract would be applied to doctors in britain .
russia and turkey : are there any alignment of a &apos; alliance &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended the crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of the eight @-@ month battle with economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the demonstration hall of st. petersburg &apos;s palace , it was obvious that ankara had the most desirable side for that compromise .
he was caught , yes .
but mr. putin &apos;s smile was quite westernised and it would have been said to have spread any temperature towards his own limited standards .
on the contrary , recep tayyip erdogan spoke several times about &quot; good friend &quot; mr. putin ; he was five times , according to a report .
i was surprised by the number of me .
he also pledged that relations with russia will not return to the pre @-@ crisis level , but to reach much higher levels .
the next day , a daily newspaper there said mr. erdogan acted as if there was no bad thing .
i think he was very excited about it .
but mr. putin &apos;s cold suburb , which the russian leader had done nothing , had shown that he did not forget about anything .
in fact , the first thing turkey mentioned in an opening statement was the cause of the crisis : that turkey shot down the russian warhead on the border with syria .
russia &apos;s response to the move was then hiddet .
mr. putin made a strong breakthrough , accusing ankara of smuggling moscow from suspending .
fraught has become much bigger and centralised as a friend of the opposing side .
real reconstruction of the trust will be difficult , perhaps impossible .
since november , the idea for the russian people has changed .
state @-@ controlled media have targeted ankara for months of blurred and aggressive .
suddenly , turks were the blame for everything .
the most serious of them were accusations by senior officials that mr. erdogan &apos;s family made profit from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so @-@ called islamic state in syria .
he flatly rejected it .
however , the official message from st. petersburg was that it was time to proceed .
finally , the reason for that meeting was that mr. putin had sought by president erdogan .
russia could see this as a kind of victory .
for ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire call are very clear .
first , erdogan needs friends following his failure to strike a coup that may have led to his overthrow last month .
terrorist attacks in turkey have long affected him .
in addition , economic reasons are active .
russia &apos;s sanctions have been tight -- especially , banning special flights that carry a few million russian tourists in turkey &apos;s coastal region every year .
that number has dropped by almost 90 % .
in russia , tour operators and leasing companies were definitely relieved that flights would continue .
they have been aghast at the end of the season in the mediterranean .
this week , state @-@ run tv predicted that with a re @-@ admission of turkish agricultural products , the prices of fruit and vegetables would be decreasing .
&quot; tourists are there , &quot; the daily vedemosti quoted him as telling the newspaper &apos;s news .
however , there was a separate political value for moscow .
ankara is angry with the west for not having enough reactions to the coup attempt .
mr. putin , who wants to capitalise on the break @-@ up and standoff with the west , is taking steps , as long @-@ standing anger over talks on the us prospects for joining the group .
after a coup attempt , the russian leader appears to have certainly gathered sympathies from ankara , citing a call to support elected officials .
it was inevitable , no , and then it was inevitable for moscow , which had a deep fear of regime change .
this summit held in the seaside palace , concurrently represents a &quot; alignment &quot; alliance of the two countries , which russia and turkey say to me : rejected by the west and where they are mistreating .
despite this consensus , however , they are far different .
one of the most important is syria : moscow has proposed itself as a mediator , but russia and turkey support the different sides .
after almost three hours of talks , the two presidents also said at a press conference that they did not address the issue .
turkey &apos;s president has clearly avoided answering a question of those differences , while mr. putin has chosen to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in syria .
but when it comes to months of open anxieties -- and in view of the absolute precipitation that turkey &apos;s possible demolition by turkey , a nato member , is certainly starting to talk at least about the potential for a russian fighter .
royalty bank ruined in scottish for customers outside the scottish
the rbs brand , according to the president of the bank executive board , will continue to maintain its backup position .
the royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers except for scotland .
the deal , ross mcewan said , was related to the bank &apos;s global prospects for scbs .
because he was almost discouraged eight years ago , it was forced to pull out and give up .
during that time , marka strategy experts used the &apos; rbs &apos; to maintain other consumer financial brands .
it was supported by millions of stereotypes for sponsors from the six @-@ nation ragbi championship to the wimbledon andy murray championship .
now , however , it was determined that it would be right for more national brands to emerge .
the new beginnings will be used by the royal bank &apos;s scottish clients , but will not be made .
except for their condition of central and payroll in the uk and galler , all horses carried out to the rbs would be altered as natwest .
the signatories of the irish republic and northern ireland are already used for a ster bank brand .
there are smaller brands to assume a much more dominant post for the individual banking field ; coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s militants bank are also present .
mr. mcewan , inverness @-@ shire held an interview for customers and staff .
&quot; the rbs brand will now be our investor brand , after which our personnel are employed , &quot; bbc to scotland told scotland .
as the bank itself became a global brand , rbs has become the global brand .
i say we are our local goals , not global .
each of these brands will represent a bit different in the community , working with our staff under the name of our clients .
the rbs announced that it would not continue its sponsorship at the six @-@ nation championship and would raise the profile of different brands when it comes to sports sponsoring .
&quot; now we &apos;ve come to get into the markalar bank understanding because ( we asked ourselves ) how can we do it a better bank for customers ? &quot; he said .
i found it to be a huge bank for our customers three years ago and if we had indicated that we would have made such brands .
however , i think you will see a lot of changes , focused on the needs of the customers , not on how we conduct it .
we can reactivate these brands , so i think it &apos;s the right time .
frankie dettori won the title for the 30th time in a dominant winner in the concurrence and newmarketplace .
he exploded after winning the 300th victory in newmarket for his double achievement in newmarket .
jokey frankie dettori won his 3000th victory in britain on friday in newmarket .
on the local runway , john gosden &apos;s predilecture and the second @-@ place finisher won their two @-@ kilo victory , reaching that milestone .
italy , 45 , is the sixth jokey player to reach this milestone .
he is following the trail of gordon richards , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
&quot; this is a special situation , &quot; said jokey , who formerly won three championship victories in ghayjar .
i have been very emotional for my parents being here
i really feel glad to see this happen in the newmarket i started 30 years ago .
this is not a crucial meeting , but a royal ascot -- it &apos;s just about 20,000 people -- friday night .
i feel compromised and relieved .
dettori accepts self @-@ financing after victory
runner @-@ up runner jokey mccoy mccoy , a pensioner who had reached the stone by the time , is his champion johnson and 20 @-@ time champion , and retired jokeswoman anthonthonth mccoy mccoy , who has won 4300 of his career as a champion .
lester pigt &apos;s career , which won nine times in the magazine competition , has 4493 victories .
frankie is one of the best jokeys of our time , and it is not surprising to achieve a kilometre that only a few people have reached before him .
he owns it and is a strong person , but tactical mentality that contributes to heavy pressure from others on the term .
she represents the horse of the horse ; her excitement and chart is running the sport .
a few weeks ago , i said the epsom might have achieved 600th victory in frankie without a joke competing in the late weeks and big competitions .
to be serious , frankie had won most of the 30 years of contestant in frankie , the united kingdom , with many of them winning , it &apos;s very good to see .
he has a very exciting character and is a very good characteristic of this british competition , which goes beyond it .
frankie dettori celebrated the changeover with the attan movement , bestling it that had become a symbol of that milestone .
from its arranged competitions , he had become a symbol of british disability , 20 years after a series of instances in their landing with ribbons .
it was a stubborn way that was stuck .
in 1996 , he won several major races including a victory of the renat &apos; great &apos; brand &apos; but remained alive in a plane crash and was banned due to a lack of compliance with the drug ban .
three years ago , during the reversal of this six @-@ month @-@ long reintegration process , he showed that he had a strong character required to unfairly disregard the suspected ones and return to the best .
and he could continue for another time ; he had previously said he was willing to stay in the competition until at least 50 .
russia &apos;s putin sacks private heir ivanov
russian president vladimir putin unexpectedly dismissed one of his special heights , ivanov .
mr. ivanov was part of a circle surrounded by mr. putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old is now tasked as a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
mr. putin &quot; has decided to end ivanov &apos;s position as head of the russian leadership , &quot; but no cause was given , the kremlin said in a statement .
anton vaino , who has been acting as a caretaker to mr. ivanov since 2012 , has been assigned to do so .
vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
in 1972 , tallinn , estonia , was born in the capital of tallinn , where the prominent moscow state institute graduated from the department of international relations ( mgimo ) , and served at the embassy in tokyo .
he was later interested in the presidential protocol and the management of the government &apos;s staff ; that is his wording on the kremlin web site ( russia ) .
&quot; i thank me because you trust me , &quot; said mr. putin after his appointment .
i think your main task is to support your activities as head of the state in terms of keeping the law and monitoring the implementation of instructions .
mr. putin announced on friday that he had asked the russian tv station mr. ivanov to withdraw and suggested mr. vaino for the replacement .
convincing smiles ?
that is a move that has shocked moscow .
sergei ivanov has long worked as one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies and served as the soviet security forces force kgb .
special heart was one of the most powerful people in the country .
in a televised session with putin , both voiced confidence about his choice for private heart .
however , despite the smiles used to the cameras , few are convinced , especially at this time of parliamentary elections .
but is there a dispute due to such a power struggle ?
no one knows this yet .
however , the official statement that a person who might be chairman would like to redirect russia &apos;s environmental policy has raised scepticism .
mr. ivanov , according to the kremlin website , was quoted as telling mr. putin : &quot; in early 2012 , it &apos;s difficult for us to speak -- even more difficult -- that i trust me for the next four years for the post .
eh , according to her , i served four years as a special pretext at the helm for eight months .
mr. ivanov took up that post in december 2011 .
he had previously served as deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a former member of the kgb state security forces , like a russian security council member and mr. putin .
at the end of the 1990s , mr. putin was head of the federal security forces ( fsb ) , which replaced the kgb , while mr. ivanov was acting as acting acting acting acting acting acting minister .
once mr. putin passed power , he cited ivanov as one of the five most trusted people .
mr. ivanov might have been president following mr. putin &apos;s second term , since mr. putin &apos;s third term as president was unconstitutional .
however , his mandate was handed over to another close ally , dmitry medvedev .
mr. putin became prime minister three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency .
thomas gibson , star of the crominal minds series , was ousted after shooting a producer .
gibson was involved in a physical feud during the series in los angeles last month .
abc studios and cbs television , who produced the series , have announced a joint statement that he is being fired .
revibson , which revives private agan aaron hotchner , had an apology on tuesday before the fesigh announcement .
differences over creative issues and a conflict were added .
&quot; i am sorry that such an incident occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
one thorny of abc studios and cbs television studios is said to have detailed information about how to remove a group of fbi fbi agents from the programme that has played .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old actor , who had previously been on a comedy for the situation dharma &amp; greg , was involved in the programme since the first season in 2005 .
&quot; i love the cripple minds and worked for the past two years by giving him the perseverance and soul , &quot; gibson said in a statement issued on friday .
i would have liked to stay until the end , but this is no longer possible .
i just want to thank the authors , the filmmakers , our great team , and , most importantly , the best supporters that a programme can have .
the programme is expected to return to the ovens for the second round on september 28th .
the mystery of fish in banff yard
one person living in the banff district has applied for assistance in the definition of fisheries found in banff &apos;s yard .

queensferry parade : bridge is now connected to fife
worth 1.35 billion euros , project needs to be completed by may 2017
engineers have combined the northern part of the queensferry line , which means the bridge is now connected to fife .
this is the first of four closed closures between the &quot; tablets &quot; that will be completed in the vicinity of each of the bridge &apos;s three towers .
kehiti , from fife , is 600m long and 30,000 tonnes of wedding .
there are 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,0000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables .
the project , worth 1.35 billion euros , must be completed by may 2017 .
economy minister keith brown was among the first people to walk through the road , visiting facilities today .
&quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the queensferry parade .
we are all masters of engineering with this project , which used only more than 30,000 tonnes to build only this segment of the bridge , and we are really destined in excellence .
despite the exceptional dimension and weight of the bridge , which closes the gap between the valley and the bridge battalion , it is a sensitive work that requires extremely sensitive tolerance for this adjustment .
in all , 79 % of the total bridge battalion is now in place , meaning that the entire battalion will be available to remove the entire coffin from the foil today in rosyth .
&quot; in all projects of bridges , the closing is always an important milestone .
this exceptional project represents its predecessor in the civil engineering .
we had to close the gap on the north -- or in the carpet -- after it was placed in the final road battalion and linked to the level of the enlarged north tower .
that , in turn , was realised when the valley in the north pulled from 700m to about south .
it was only a very delicate procedure , but also a very delicate process .
the main reason was the need for the valley to be 22m tall , almost 6,000 tonnes of weightlifting and to withdraw in about 3 % .
the delicate reason was that the team &apos;s tolerance values it must abide by were very low , with only a few millimetres on both sides .
fortunately , everything went on track .
moelfre gulf rescue team : &apos; lucky &apos; because three men are alive
the three men were &quot; lucky because they survived &quot; by their fishermen at anglesey .
moelfre rnli limani issued an alert friday to the british summer goalkeeper at 13 : 20 pm after being hit by the debacle in the thermoelectric gulf of tertiary .
the three had been striving to swim into a safe field while the vessels were still on their own .
&quot; we have seen that the technique has drawn up the right bodies to them , and we have covered the anxiety , &quot; he said , retaining the court &apos;s control .
&quot; fortunately , we moved away with strong winds , ranging from the right road to the right one , &quot; he added .
two of them were rescued by a local fishermen , while a third , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old boy , was found to have spent a box office without her death .
they were all brought to a lifetime @-@ roofing fleet to the coast , and brought to the lifeline movie station station .
&quot; the three men who have fallen into the water are lucky because they are alive and have never served .
in the boat engine , an emergency was a nightmare to stop the situation , but it should have sounded by a person who used the boat when the vessel was buy it .
this three men were watching each other today .
a valuable auxiliary form , pokémon go for health and happiness
it is deeply condemned to see how the world has really changed .
young people and children no longer go out to play for the game , chose to spend their free time looking at the screens , many felt sorry over the past decade .
pokemon would encourage guarantors to move from the bottom .
time spent looking at the screens , with the latter limited to television , the video games , and finally spread to smart phones .
for this reason , it is really great to see that there are no substantive factors in moving technology and open air .
of course , i would talk about pokémon go , a practice based on characters , playoffs , playwright cards and other affiliations that were created in the 1990s , especially created for the video play game .
like many phenomena of popular culture , this new game included an average of views when it was presented in the us , australia and new zealand in early july .
later , their presentation was postponed in other countries due to the strong interest that prompted overload .
within days , poémon go tinder has more than the same number of users than that of its twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players come by telephone with their intelligent phones to look for pommekémon , followed by the gps , and can call &apos; look at their clouds &apos; ( with look up in the phone ) or &apos; . &apos;
for a younger generation who played for the play , he was candid and participated in this cradle .
in the united states , the play &quot; average &quot; has significantly increased the number of steps a person has taken daily .
cardiogram , a project developed for apple watch and its 35,000 users , monitoring 35,000 users , said that the percentage of people who unegged in the next two days between them in the wake of the washington post , climbed from 45 per cent to 53 per cent a day .
the company does not know who played pokémon go , but only at an unlawful level , inspiration .
the public health campaign , which encouraged people to &quot; separate 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; get out of the law &quot; and &quot; active every day , &quot; was ignored because most public health messages were ridiculed and mistakenly conveyed by the contested individuals .
still , the importance of egzero remains to be seen .
the chances of individuals holding regularly without eggs , cancer or depression are decreasing .
he helps with issues such as egzery , high blood pressure , diabetes and diabetes , as well as a list of benefits that cannot be listed there .
however , the beauty of pokémon go is to get people out in order to do something they enjoy .
in this way , three key aspects of health are also covered : movement , clean air and sun lights , and entertainment .
some are able to obtain new friends during the hunt .
as usual , there are insurgents seeking something to complain .
and of course it can be spectacular at the door as one progresses .
what makes a difference ?
a major innovation was presented .
the wise phone practices , such as fitbit , had to offer us no reason to be exhausted as this game .
the impact of innovation and use will decline , and will decline over time .
but due to the success of pokémon , implementation and virtual reality will be brought in to a host of plays that are helping to be more active , forbidden and healthy , by combining activism in real world activities .

simone biles wins gold in women &apos;s gymnastics general assessment
forget about the pressure .
forget about the excitement .
simone biles had a donation of all of them .
he is dynamic when it comes to throw .
the balance is at ease .
condemnation is stationed somewhere .
it is primarily resembling .
and he is now an olympic champion .
american gymnast , 19 , made it clear thursday that he and the rest of the world , finishing first in a general evaluation .
with a total score of 62.198 , aly raisman , a silver medalist and friend of the &quot; last five &quot; team , and alija mustafina , the russian bronze medalist .
simone biles of the united states performed as a balance in the women &apos;s artistic gymnastics final at the 2016 rio de janeiro summer olympics in brazil on thursday .
biles was the fourth and fifth americans , who received the prize for general assessment in the background and announced it as best for her own generator and , perhaps , the best of all time .
the last time was based on their tears , which came to an end by long ago .
this achievement has raised the level to the same level as athletes , such as michael phelps , who can be seen once in every generation that brings sports to new levels :
biles described the last three years as one of the most successful athletes , including 15 gold , and the 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton , who named him &quot; the best gymnast i have seen so far . &quot;
he was waiting for a last test in brazil -- it was more burdensome than among those in the area of tickets and other people in the field .
he was likely to be seen as a disappointment that would see his family home in the sprint with a handful of gold medals .
the united states &apos;s simone biles , left , and aly raisman , won the gold and silver medal in the overall assessment of women in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 rio de janeiro summer olympics in brazil , respectively .
biles won first place on tuesday , when he was serving as a celebratory sign in the farewell party of retired national team co @-@ ordinator martha karolyi .
though biles insisted that he had never seen any further in this long run on his way , his position is not fully accurate .
the portion , which includes the swollen practice of atzeros that had become a symbol of your soul , was worked with latin music that would fully adapt to the street just outside rio olympic arena .
this is not a coincidence .
the girl , whose mother @-@ in @-@ law was admitted to a smaller child by her great father and grandfather , was found on a tour of the icon in a gymnastics hall where aimee bodeforestation coached .
since the summer of 2013 , they have not lost one of the general assesments , making it a win to continue as long as they want to know .
mustafina was the leader in two paths , but this was a parade .
the balance beam and ineconomical fairytals that biles won the world championship title have not yet been made .
the balance event scored a score of 15.433 , which included 15.933 points .
raisman was shaken up to the end of the score , waiting for nezaketen , and biles once written a smear book , while the spectacular red on the outdoor side of the light red , white and blue seatbelt .
raisman &apos;s performance was like a reflection of the performance four years ago , when he lost his fourth place and then lost the bronze to mustafina .
this time around , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , named &quot; nine , &quot; had passed it .
time around , he sent a relic to the crowd after a seemingly suspicious return to the crowd .
for biles , 19 @-@ year @-@ old tweet is very much shared earlier this week that it is now completely new .
police : 3 sacrifice victims highlighted in serial killer &apos;s case , listening to music
two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl was shot in phoenix &apos;s first case of a serial killer in ten years , where he was speaking in the car on thursday , according to police reports .
on june 12th , officials said , the daughter of angela rochelle , stefanie r. ellis and ellis , maleah , was shot in the car along a waiter road .
the report says that the gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car , shooting eight shots at pistol and moving away with another vehicle .
police say they did not appear mature to have committed these three murders because they did not receive all hand bags or $ 2,900 money from aggressive adult victims .
a spokesman for the phoenix police , commissioner jonathan howard , said that the gun attack was directed by researchers to examine whether it was connected to the previous four attacks .
in all , seven people were killed and two others were injured in the nine attacks on neighbourhoods in weightlifting , in which they lived mainly in spanish origins .
&quot; this was a settlement in front of a house , &quot; howard said earlier this month , before a cbs investigator .
the suspect is thought to have used a few vehicles that include a black and white cadillac or lincoln in a model towards the end of 1990 .
the researchers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and carried out by the same killer .
ellis ( 33 ) was admitted to hospital for their injuries , and he was subsequently killed .
liner ( 31 ) and ellis &apos; daughter , maleah , were killed on the scene .
one person who was involved in the incident said that it was not unusual for them to listen to music by sitting in the park that they had parked .
at the same time , authorities published a police report on the case of the shooting against a truck that targeted three hours earlier than three killings .
researchers found shells , issued a comedy from a seat and located scattered pieces in the dividing of motor .
the 6 @-@ year @-@ old mother of mikrosefali says &quot; a better situation &quot;
like many six @-@ year @-@ old children , edmund picciuto likes singing , singing his toys and , of course , the mother .
however , in edmund to edmund , his mother , elizabeth picciuto , remains unaware of her presence during the apparatus , which is a genetic disability that his mother , elizabeth picciuto , had no knowledge of her presence during her passion .
when it came back to the house , my first thoughts were that i could not be able to do so .
i can &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t want that .
these are not true , of course , that &apos;s not true , of course you would like it to , too , &quot; he said .
he and his wife vincent have said that edmund can never recognise them and even survive .
some doctors went as far as to offer the investment in the care house .
&quot; my first reaction was to say that i &apos;m not thinking that people are doing this anymore , &quot; picciuto said .
edmund can walk with the help of a frenchman .
edmund was not able to sit down or retire until he turns three , and can still speak .
however , he has been slow in reaching some crossroads .
she can walk and bike by providing help .
in addition , he likes playing and singing with his two brothers .
elizabeth points out that edmund deserves to give me the song &quot; because it means me singing . &quot;
picciuto told cbs news &quot; we teach it the sign language . &quot;
as we know , however , edmund says he is following his own signs .
mikrosefali can come forward with a series of different situations : a genetic situation such as edmund may be present and a source of infections that have created frescoes , such as cannabis and rodiofs during the expiration .
signs and the navigation of the disease could demonstrate a huge difference .
it is still too early to say how life of people with the zika infection can be affected .
picciuto recalls the emotional baby that his future poses in limbo .
i always asked what &apos;s going to happen .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and he is still unfamiliar with this .
in fact , i have not asked my father for a long time to tell me that i was really told of the disease .
picciuto , however , has been able to present promising recommendations for the mothers of babies , who were the substitution due to zika .
a better situation .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will enjoy your children , and you will enjoy you too .

simone , gabby and laurie for what we need
this year &apos;s women were the olympic gymnastics team , which i called this , and there are several reasons for that .
first , i had participated in all summer olympics since 1984 , and the united states had never had been so dominant .
second , this team has three gymnasiums that inspire many girls of ethnic origin : simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; hernanie &quot; hernandemi .
the structure of this team , coalesce raisman and catholic madison kocian , makes all proud .
the team finally seems to be similar to america .
at the same time , it strengthened the presence that women of siji and latin @-@ origin hold on top of the sport .
in the past four years , the first woman gymnast has always become an american of african origin .
last year , simone and gabby placed 2nd and 2nd in the ranking .
it is a strong thing .
in recent olympics , gabby douglas was a surprise olympic champion and backed by america .
simone biles , douglas and laurie hernandez , now making three world champions , are likely to have played an extraordinary performance of gymnastics rallies that have only unexpected .
on thursday , simone became the fourth us to win a gold medal in the overall assessment of women .
and his teammate , aly raisman , won the silver .
we know the best times of the sport , but the atmosphere in gymnastics throughout the country does not seem to exist .
simone , gabby and laurie had the same path as aly and madison to be part of the olympic teams .
the reason for them to be &quot; last five &quot; will be only four gymnast on the next olympic gymnastics team , which will be marta karolyi &apos;s last year of coaching .
in reality , however , gymnastics is highly expensive sport and gymnasts are mostly working in private gymnastics clubs , which have more money paid by parents , including education , travel , forma , competition , hotel fees ( coaches , gymnasiories and families ) , among others .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in the wealthy suburban neightworking neightworking neighbourhoods that can handle the business .
these clubs require a costly and long @-@ term commitment to the families of the gymnasts , the only place where gymnasts can receive training .
simone biles trainer aimee bodev and laurie hernandez &apos;s coach , magu maggie haney , are instructing them since they began moly&apos;s gymnasium .
for the numerous young girls affected by simone , gabby and laurie , we do not offer communities an affordable and more accessible gymnastics .
i founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
in my estonian , harlem @-@ based ceremonies offered free and costly gymnastics to over 15,000 young people in the town , among them , and offered codes for both national and international championships .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( where i am growing ) to present the opportunity to learn this wonderful olympic sport and offer quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to benefit from it .
gymnastics , the body &apos;s strength , flexibility and co @-@ ordination , provides hard work , discipline and determination .
this combination offers long @-@ term benefits for success in health care , school and business .
it will be an inspiration and a great thing for the team to direct thousands of young girls to the gymnast .
participation in sporting activities is especially important for girls .
we are really going through sensational times .
simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison all of them brought in a gold medal as the olympic team , compelling for many young girls who clearly showed &quot; the power of the girls &quot; and had different plans to become a healthy and successful young woman .
following jeremy hunt &apos;s rejection of bid , asian doctors agree to go ahead with strikes
the ministers hoped that the dispute would come to an end after the deal was signed with the members of the british conglomerate , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 asymmets who participated in the vote voted against .
in july , mr. hunt announced plans to sanction the contract , stating that &quot; no one is located &quot; and that further delay would harm personnel and the patients .
the first subordinate group underwent a new contract that includes changes in the night and practice of working at the end of the week , in order to improve care out of normal hours .
&quot; there are still serious concerns about the proposed charter of aspirant doctors , especially that it will trigger the current labour crisis and it does not seem to have an equal attitude towards all the doctors , &quot; according to dr ellen mccourcourt , the head of bma &apos;s asi doctors committee .
with just eight weeks left to pass a new contract by the first medical group , progress must be made and time is existent .
bma &apos;s efforts to settle the dispute were met with the government &apos;s unwillingness to establish interaction and , in some cases , with shaky silence .
it is a development despite a promise by jeremy hunt last month that the door should always be open .
&quot; jeremy hunt needs to act now , remove my contract and heed the concerns of aspiring doctors . &quot;
there is a clear sign that they are prepared to increase business slowers if they do not do so .
the latest strike in late april forced the almost 13,000 routine operations and the arrange of 100,000 randomers , nurses and consultants to take care of doctors in the strike line .
the ministers hoped that the dispute would come to an end after the contract was signed with the members of the british conglomerate .
bma wants to improve the prices at the weekend for the country &apos;s 5,000 assistants .
the executive board of the nhs employers , daniel mortimer , called on asstos doctors not to execute any strike .
&quot; the strike won &apos;t solve anything , but the hard line is cause for pressure on the team and the services , which would create pressure on them and the services , causing concern , comfort and concern for their families , &quot; said mr. mortimer .
over the past two months , we have continued our talks with the aspirant committee and approached positively the health ministry and other officials , as well as their concerns about absorbing .
the important issues -- including distribution , education flexibility , education flexibility , training costs for those who interrupted in their careers , a mutual understanding on the mutual understanding of curriculum , education permits and the mature gender pay gap -- were cited as a positive sign of hope for continued positive action , in november and february by the british ministry of health and education .
during 2 days , survivors could eliminate heart attack danger
thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from two pharmacies per day after authorities recommended giving more time to the authorities .
relor , which prevents abundance of pure , reduces the risk of crisis against individuals who have undergone heart .
he was given for 12 months following the heart crisis , which had to reduce the risk of paralysis or another crisis .
nhs observers recommended that it be given to people for four years , in order to further reduce the risk of problems with nice , cardiovascular registrations .
however , the nhs observers now suggested that it be given to individuals for four years to further reduce the risk of problems in nice , cardiovascular .
around 140,000 people suffer from heart attacks every year in the united kingdom , a quarter of which is in another crisis or paralysis .
cardiovascular than heart attacks and paralysis are the reason for the accumulation of vegetables on one of the tire arch walls .
if the plate falls apart , this could cause blood samples and cause a heart attack by blocking the blood pressure .
and paralysis is paralysed in the bloodshed and is paralysed in the event it spills out of the dog .
the risk of a crisis by those who had already spent a crisis is higher .
established by the united kingdom trade firm astrazeneca , the united kingdom is decreasing the risk , reducing the likelihood of its edge .
today &apos;s nice manual proposes that the men be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months , and , later , two years on a day , along with aspiring .
&quot; although effective secondary medicine prevention treatments exist , about a quarter of those who had heart attacks are undergoing another heart attack or paralysis , and the results are often devastating , &quot; said professor carole longson , an administrator at the nice health technology evaluation centre .
the fear of recording can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of one .
deliller shows that using ticagrelu along with aspirin , with heart attack and paralysis reduction in the risk of paralysing in those who had previously suffered a heart attack .
with ticar temporarily proposed , we are pleased to increase custom options for treating thousands of people waiting to take advantage of it .
the manual does not recommend any treatment after that period , since information that has passed through three years -- specifically , the risk of blood feuds -- is limited .
pc culture ratifies voter fraud in muslim areas
former tower movement president lutfur rahman was dismissed from his post after a government report last year .
as the destructive government report now shows , the culture of political accuracy has led to widespread despair among muslim communities .
former cabinet minister eric pickles dismissed election observers and the municipal palace of municipal authorities for abuse of power due to &quot; extreme sensitivity on ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former community secretary and today &apos;s anti @-@ corruption circle is so appealing for voters to be intimidated on religious grounds , and it is necessary to allow police to exclude voter turnout to protect corners .
voters suggested they have their identities with each other to prove their identity at a time of voting .
and as things stand now , it &apos;s enough for the electorate to speak the name and address .
the report even suggested that a permanent crew be set up during the vote to prevent individuals from voting twice .
those found in a tip should be better preserved , he said .
he called for better access to the press to determine the documents and the decisions of non @-@ formal committees or working groups .
&quot; it is not only intended to provide protection against fraud in the elections , but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud , which has been addressing it , &quot; he said .
the report was prepared under the orders of tower movement ts following london &apos;s vote scandal .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that mayor lutfur rahman would be removed from his post , following repeated corruption and illegal practices .
rahman found that the muslim community &quot; misused &quot; its religious feelings and misused him with accusations of racism and islamophobia , the court said .
rahman was quoted as saying that &quot; the participation of beliefs in his campaign was based on the basis that it was a religious duty . &quot;
the play up to 300 years ago was suspicious , and was the result of the consequences of using false id cards , i.e. , voting as obeyed .
there was evidence of fraud conducted throughout the country , said eric .
in particular , he warned of corruption in vote @-@ rigging -- that the muslim community pressured older individuals to vote for the island they chose .
eric has made some proposals for the organisation of the voting system , including having an identity card to prove who individuals are .
&quot; there has been evidence of pressure on some ethnic minority communities to vote in compliance with the will of the elderly in their communities of pakistani and bangladesh , especially among women and youth .
&quot; there have been concerns that state institutions ignore such behaviour because of the &quot; political accuracy &quot; of ethnicity and religion . &quot;
he suggested 50 proposals for the organisation of the system , including the obstruction of the post and voting papers from political activists in order to prevent them from processing &quot; for votes . &quot;
the report , conducted by theresa may , also called for tightening registration checks to prevent the use of electoral mass immigration and welfare corruption .
the choice for voter &apos;s id card before voting is considered a requirement .
in the wake of the vote to prevent one person from voting twice , the employment of the person is permanent .
systematic checks on the nationality of an individual are conducted to determine eligibility .
a three @-@ year restriction of demands for an automated vote was imposed on automates .
political campaigners and activists have been banned from processing the votes and mail that were sent by postings that have been completed .
police are authorised to draw landslides into the circle of voting cables .
amended the law on public representation in 1983 to fend off charges of terrorising people under the law of representation .
it is law to exclude photography from voting cabins .
it is essential that only english talk , except those in the voting cabs ( in the same time ) .
reinforcing training is that the staff receives for voter isolation as a result of the rule .
br eric criticised the police force for being brutally critical , saying it was &quot; interesting &quot; for failing to indict any charges in the tower movement .
&quot; the electoral court ruled that charges for lutfur rahman and his representative were not exist on charges of corruption and illegal activities , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty on a series of grounds , beyond reasonable suspicions -- in the qualification of the criminal evidence .
he also criticised municipal authorities for their &quot; cheap signal &quot; in the electoral registration department of the municipality .
&quot; tower movement was an alarm alert to last year &apos;s court decision .
although our nation has the urgency to form the memories of our parliaments , it may be a cause for the spread of anxiety and hidden electoral fraud and the rejection by some institutions that would undermine that good reputation .
kate a cyclist type of bike , and a horse for other faithful siblings of rio olympic players .
this week , the 2016 olympics of rio 2016 games were turned into a fence for french cyclist pauline ferrand @-@ prevot , who has proven to be impressive in falling out in the mosque .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old olympic sportsman is not the only one to draw attention to the similarities as he struggles for a gold medal this summer , and the social media think so .
for this reason , all the famous olympic athletes that we saw in the rio games and carpet screens prepared the list of those who resembled , more than resembling them by femail , hollywood celebrities .

and oxu agreed that he resembled this madness in social media , resembling himself as leo since childhood .
brady told the huffington post : &apos; i don &apos;t think it &apos;s very big similar , except that i have a lot of similarities .
&quot; it &apos;s a respectable man , so i think it &apos;s an interest .
there is one similarly similarly one of london &apos;s most popular events in 2012 , which will deal with it this year even more : the unbelievable siasm of british longtime athlete , greg rutherford , to the popular actor neil patrick harris .
russian gymnast alija mustafina was quoted as saying that the great and meaningful minister and the american artist gloria estefan from cuba was a reader .
and in pool , south african swimmer cameron van der burgh has compared to matthew morrison , the star of glee , for years .
amendment : this user said nathan &apos;s initial movie is a &quot; spontaneous version &quot; of nathan &apos;s star .

harsh women : football star hope solo ( left ) and the star of dexter , jennifer carpenter ( right ) , have a similar face and eyes .
there is not alone : a twitter user , a man delighted with the likelihood of this similarity of other people .
one theory that is available in the air : that it can be a reason behind the fact that the pair is the similar outlook .
a twitter user spearheaded this site , where he said he was &quot; pleased that the rest of the internet is like if you &apos;re like a while on hope solo and jennifer carpenter . &quot;
in reality , the actress who plays for the us football star and dexter has similar singers and eyes .
other popular events include the kerri walsh @-@ jenns and actress laura linney , who likened a smiling smiling with each other , as well as the great sulphur of another gold medalist , gabby douglas , and the star of the youth fire , gabrias united .

the primark custom was a fury against a woman who tried a scary internal wrist in the middle of the store .
customers could not know what they will do when a woman appoints her clock to try a restaurant in the middle of primark .
even worse , she looked at and repaired how it seemed to happen in her field .
he continued to look at , and later tried four painting interiors at the bouverie place shopping mall in radan .
she was the primark store at the bouverie place shopping mall in foggy in the outlet of foot before repairing the woman was picked up .
jenny davidson , a mother of two young children in the department at the store , said that the mysterious woman went on to recording his interior mouth after refreshing and he got out of store without anything .
&quot; people didn &apos;t believe in their eyes .
he stopped in the middle of the store and made a copy of his shop , pulling his cultural soul and pantola , and weighed on it .
&quot; they didn &apos;t try to find a special place to do so , but they stopped with all due respect .
when she pulled a sculpture , all looked at it and was evident she didn &apos;t like a culprit because it was back on the shelf again .
until they decided that he didn &apos;t like anything , he tried three more coats and then moved out of the store .
&quot; it looked like those who followed it did not seem like they would like to care , and they did not think of the heroes he was then buying . &quot;
&quot; the more she wears it , how much to think that somebody will get a hectare of one cult or another , and he will go to the house , &quot; said the woman &apos;s davidson ( 33 ) , a resident of the town .
the incident took place on tuesday afternoon .
the woman &apos;s davidson added : after that , i think she got the staff out of selling the dresses in her way , which is good .
when i got a new cult and went home , it was really bad to me to think if he wears someone else and that he was in no way stuffed , &quot; he said .
a baby spokesman : &apos; primark &apos; was the news of the incident at our department in folkestone on tuesday ( august 9th ) .

how you can defend yourself against armed attacks
such a video offered by dailymailymail.com could help you become more trusted .
we have met with chief master rhon mizrachi in the new york @-@ based krav maga federation to know how to deal with armed robbers in the close distance .
this video , for example , will tell you , how to turn the situation into the opposite of the robbery .
mizrachi says that when your back to your back home , your first thing was to return to the face , to see the attacker and say &apos; well under fire &apos; .
you will then hit the face of your vacuum by covering the gun between your preliminary and ombudsperson .
then when you throw them down , the fire will take on the fire , turning it in the back and back in the back , but the gun and weapons will remain in the back and forth , in the back , the detachment of him will remain in the back .
when the gun person approached , a similar technique will be exercised , by firing your body from the waterfalls , and in the way that the gun and the attacker cannot fire .
at the same time , you are doing so by erasing your weight , profiting from the anti @-@ terrorist region in the chest region in ghana , thereby turning it into weapons and thriving it .
is an allottery ?
to see how mirachi did it , the video is passed to see how she does so .
but when you are not a krav maga spree , if you are the one who would take the safest way to avoid every genocide , it would be to pet your money .
georgian wright takes his wish for travel guide to europe &apos;s most pickup
in a serious test , he had put out a immune system and accreditation by instituting some of the most pis and needles in europe .
servers and georgians , ian wright ( 51 ) , issued a euro banknote to prove the power of the immune system , a pickup circus , a train grid signature and a baby phone call in russia .
before infuriating every object , he and we used a recipe to demonstrate what kind of work is connected to him and us .
however , the experimental results came some surprising results , which will be transformed into a movie by the lickhiker to inner strength .
although it is deeply blind to keep a fund in a trend used by thousands of people , there is a much worse view of the cuisine lavables in fact .
during his tour in europe , mr. wright wright wright met with doctors and medical experts in connection with the increase and health .
fortunately , there has been no discrepancies in what he left on his mouth .
mr. wright wright wright wright wright wright wright was known for visiting the world and testing its leg &apos;s resilience by lagging and cracking down .
that stumbling on , ranging from the pharmacies at the railway stations to the weddings of the toilet simulator , tested the immune system .
in the movie about that , he said that i have not been a child since i was childhood , and i have put many things in agony as far as the soil , the left and the mud .
during the film , he finally proved his motive .
the only thing he refused was a pis retrumpet in russia .
more than 4,000 units conducted a succession .
by comparison , the number of these new departments must be lower than 60 .
however , the newly depleted hands included a numa metre , which was less than 60 and was refused to lie when the census was higher than 4,000 submerged .
mr. wright wright wright wright wright wright wright wright and finnish milk products producer valio claimed the trader &apos;s gude to inner strength , which shows the number of copies in different locations like banyo .
he said he went to the movie : &apos; it &apos;s close to being one of the worst things i had coded with in a toilet .
there can be no more thing than that !
i will not lie anything because i are disgusted .

mitigation in mine health claims it has become a global phenomenon
instead of simply talking about products , we wanted to give our products a much bigger context ; daily , good and bad bacteria in our environment is linked to the importance of the mixture and its immune system .
interest in the wellbeing is becoming a global phenomenon , and we have told consumers that in this case , we can offer much more information .
at the same time , i think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; i can say that i have lost my respect to some things that i wanted to lie like the nephew russian toilets shown in the movie , &quot; said tom hakala , who directed the film .
naturally , some were easy to induce some things , but some were very difficult .
i am happy that we got some of these dialect lignite actions .
in a survey conducted in 2015 by valio , 84 per cent of respondents associated their klaktic asit copies with a mixture of good health , and 58 per cent said they used their products as arbitrary , with laboratories .

family now out of housing , purportedly taken to take advantage of private accommodation options
cornwall housing director donna mcevy said he was afraid the situation would be salvaged .
&quot; this is really a nightmare for people here , and i think that people should not have to live in this way .
there is a lot to be taken into account , as this property is now known as a very non @-@ pleasant part of cornwall .
this family possess a bad fame and their names have a poor reputation .
the family had three dairies living occasionally , and according to police , the family used a sleigh in the street to fight the baseball with baseball painting , terrorising nearby residents , selling drugs , and excessing exceptional behavioural behavioural behavior , and eing fake behavioural behavioural behavioural .
in june , an anti @-@ social decision was made for skeldon ( 47 ) , whose name is known in the contract for rent .
old landfills found in house where demolition is believed to have been demolished
drug @-@ fuelled property detected in the past
neighbours say they see war on the streets and that police are often searching
cornwall housing forced him and his wife to leave the property this week after 11 weeks of prolonged to transport voluntarily .
the evacuation was greeted with relief by neighbours who said their life was turning back to mile .
one person said : &apos; no one did they care &apos; .
we have been with them for 20 years and the situation was always bad .
when we tell you that once we see police here , you can &apos;t believe .
&quot; we didn &apos;t sleep this morning .
we were on the alert because the average was too quiet ; we didn &apos;t get used to it !
finally , things will be great .
adam fitzpatrick , a nector of cornwall housing , said the family is not co @-@ operating with the local government .
for 20 years , family lived in that house , and my mouth was often urged by police
fourteen times as a social housing was covered , wreckage garbage and old toys on its side
thai added : it is really shameful that the &apos; tenant &apos; does not take any responsibility regarding the release of his or her family ; for eviction , it was always the option that cornwall housing has finally approached .
it was very difficult , since behaviour was too extreme and its actions were frightened by neighbours , which should not be indifferent .
i appreciate the efforts of members of the community who put forward their team , together with devon and cornwall police forces , to give us information .
i hope that this development will bring some relief to neighbours and as a message that there will be no tolerance for antisocial behavior .
mr fitzpatrick said they had three sons living in the property at different times , but they were in their 20s .

in 2014 , police printed property , putting up more than 70 grams of cannabis , refrigerators , special items and 1,700 of them in cash .
skeldon was fined the fine after agreeing with the intention to sell it to a criminal enterprise .
the money , he alleged , would be used to get a tomb for his son , lee skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after she was left homeless , tanya and her wife are now surrounded by a private residence in plovdiv .
most of the houses found graffiti in their walls .
police say they will work to evacuate tenants who violate pollution rules
angela crow , a member of the devon and cornage police , said the allocation is a warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules .
he said , &quot; this is a message for the people who can behave as they want without having to face any clues and think that their behaviour will be in vain . &quot;
the devon and cornwall police forces will never tolerate crime and anti @-@ social behaviour , as they continue to work with their partners to protect society .
tourists in portugal crossed the wreckage as a low @-@ flying military plane plane flew near the plane .
frenzied in portugal , aveiro tourists see their limelight
portuguese air force p @-@ 3c orchestras plane low
the air force says this is a training flight , but insists there is no risk of safety .
this is what tourists began to panic as a low @-@ flying couple slipped off .
the drama shows a close military plane at the level of contact with sprinklers in aveiro , a town in northern portugal .
vacationers rushed to worry about the noise caused by jet engines without seeing what is the right thing to do with the clouds .
the incident occurred at costa nova , near aveiro , in the afternoon .
daniel fernandes , one of the few vacations that shared the drama soon @-@ to @-@ round videotapes in the social media , said : &quot; she has passed away twice and appeared to be skewed at one point . &quot;
nuno arroja added : &apos; i had been telling , and as i was obeying , i felt the plane would have been over . &apos; &quot;
tourists from the beach in aveiro hurried to the demolition as the plane pulled through the smelter began flying at an extremely low price .
the portuguese air force said that today &apos;s p @-@ 3c orion aircraft are on an training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast , and that it is up to as low as it is the only way to control them .
because the sluggish sluggish was seemingly intractable due to a dire smoke coming from the fire , the aircraft said , the air forces insisted no one was jeopardised by the intention of police .
this summer , wildfires severely destroyed certain parts of portugal &apos;s main roads and led to the death of four people on the island of madeira .
the portuguese air force said that today , the pilot would have to fly in hand due to the circumstances , which make the view difficult -- intensive sis and duman caused by the wildfires that have ripped out of the spotlight .
the plane was flying in , and as part of the unusual denomination , it was supposed to identify pilots of pilots of fishermen .
longtime girl joined by investigator killed in syria
kadiza sultana , one of the three british women travelers who left london last year to join the ishd , was reportedly killed in syria .
atnime akunjee , a lawyer , said his family had received information about his death in syria a few weeks ago .
the itv news reported on thursday that he was thought to have died in a russian airstrike in the country &apos;s rival region , where the group was strong .
sultana was 17 , where his family masked a plan to flee the war @-@ damaged country and return to the united kingdom .
&quot; we hope this will underline that , for others , it is truly risky to go to war regions as a tomb and a testament , and that people will discourage in making this choice . &quot;
two girls from sultana and east london were flown to turkey in february 2015 , where they boarded a plane and then to the syrian border .
sultana &apos;s family was told to be married with a fire fighter in syria and to stave off in months .
reid says she will not give up garland as top court candidate if clinton elects
harry reid , leader of the senate democrats , said he believed the democrats would nominate judge merrick garland for the supreme court in the election of a presidential candidate , hillary clinton .
the republican republics in the senate have been blocking the verification process since president barack obama named him as his choice in march .
the majority leader of the senate , mitch mcconnell , said he would choose a new president to replace former supreme court judge antonin scalia .
clinton believes in the choice of garland will pick garland , and &quot; we have reasons for this , &quot; reid said in an apparent speech thursday .
a spokesman for reid later said he had spoken directly with clinton about whether he would nominate garland .
he praised garland and said clinton &apos;s team did not want to &quot; spoil the current situation &quot; by making a new choice .
garland is the presiding judge at the us court of appeal in columbia , columbia .
reid said that hep was the &quot; injured beneficiaries &quot; and &quot; burns &quot; of republicist donald trump .
trump has said it is not eligible for the post .
treats said that for women as much as they are for men , they also favour a &apos; plaque calendar calendar &apos; .
the magazine treats is working with photographer david bellemere to identify with the photographer who was preparing and prepared for 2017 from pirelli in the 1970s .
however , instead of well @-@ known and circus people , the new generation of teenagers is working to find top models for the calendar .
steve shaw , president of treats , said earlier this year that the magazine is different from the old playboy , which was high preferred earlier this year , because &quot; the playground is for the men . &quot;
i do this for women .
clearly , he believes that the timetable is like that .
&quot; we need , like men , to return to the classic license plates that do not sophisticated to look at the images of the women &apos;s body as a source of comfort in this regard , &quot; shaw said in a press release on the calendar .
because of its beautiful art , women will want to be part of this project .
models can send photos or participate in open discussions in los angeles and new york .
vinil target : who is in reality ?
the middle ages are simply besieged by men &apos;s vines .
let us tell us that this statement was based on the actual data of the body before they went to the police department to insult them with so many times that they do not like that , but rather to make sure they could do so .
according to yougov , it is not a result of the suspense that the plate created by the placement of plates that are a subject of far @-@ reaching topics : the return of the plates , which is a physical object , is the result of nostalgia in the middle ages .
recently , the virtue album purchase is mostly between 45 and 54 .
based on his subordinate , the 18 @-@ 24 @-@ year @-@ old group is the lowest .
it is not only caused by the accumulating of the martyrs &apos; action ; it is emotionally important ; it is usually old criterion buyers who like to hide their sentiments ( 56 % and 53 % ) and is arbitrary ( 69 % and 66 % ) .
but are yougov &apos;s results true ?
if this blog had been a news on the tv set , the camera soho was walking on a crowded street in a handful of grey team gloves , while many jesus first and his hands were making many jesus exhibitions and , and then , i can say , &quot; let &apos;s just think , &quot; let &apos;s say . &quot; let &apos;s time , &quot;
then , let &apos;s think about it .
soho &apos;s centre is slowly losing its magnitude and exclude ( the buildings , once independents with an independent vendors ) , and still have a few specialties with hotels , eats , prets , prets and papergates .
i would probably prefer to stop the camera for the next part ; i would have tried to learn about their age and emotional status through monitoring by simulating some of these stores by standing near some of the different men .
sor ray : two young women , three middle @-@ aged women , go to reckless records ( the data count , eight middle @-@ aged men ) , and i as a woman in 20 years after a meeting in london ( 55 ) , where he spends a few hours and a few hours in an early afternoon for a meeting .
i ask for a collector .
&quot; i think so , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these platforms , which were formally located on the ground ( it sent me with e @-@ mail ) , decorates the walls of the room for sitting in bosnia and herzegovina ( stuffing it until her home ) .
it is partly due to the fact that it reaped so many albums and syndicates -- in part , when it is first available -- that it can buy the plates that it can afford to buy back in time for the young , meteoric times .
&quot; most of what i get was 70 bumps with the end of the 60s , when i was 11 or 12 years old , i am very young to get , &quot; she said .
the plak buys agree that it is likely to stay alone ; there are people who are flowing to drink , who are flooded . &quot; smoking , i don &apos;t get a good blood alcohol , &quot; he said .
that is my bad cause .
wez , who works for sor ray ( 25 ) , also thinks most of the customers he encountered are complying with the yougov profile .
he realised , however , that a new wave of events affected by the exaggerated media is created , while people who feel that the mob has been restored , need to recover old plates .
during my talks , i normally realised that people in 1998 or 1999 have an overhaul of their collections .
customers who first sold their cranes to buy cds are now selling cds to buy their platforms . &quot;
this can explain the growth of a particular person who revives vini .
but what &apos;s the emotional significance of the either plaintiffs ?
a few seconds , it takes you to realise that plaster stores can offer a flawed community of similar personalities in a store like phony , like phonica .
according to wez , some older @-@ year @-@ old big customers had gone to the system of non @-@ contact pay .
some cranes can seek refuge at the stability of shady plaque tracks , which have become a reminder of their resemblance and retrospective youth memories from around the world .
&quot; sometimes it is a reason to fill in a vacuum or see the material as a sort of comfort , &quot; said wez .
i was a collector for myself , and that &apos;s what i think is also a lot of people .
it &apos;s an easy way to fill your café .
&quot; we are like social workers , &quot; said a colleague who was jumping out of a plaque .
a poll conducted in april revealed that 50 % of the vinyd album has not yet heard about albums .
at the same time , the survey found that 41 % had a pickup and 7 % bought the vines , although they had never used it .
in that phase of news , i was very concerned about when they focused on a series of bosna nova accounts , probably on a series of bosses .
that is a &quot; reward &quot; for return . ( data census : three middle @-@ aged egyptians ) recognized by jonny ( 42 ) .
&quot; one recent came to me , and he said , &quot; i have no platforms but want to take a radiohead platforms to carry out our shelf . &quot;
though this does not represent a large percentage , it reflects the current situation .
more products are products , fewer music .
&quot; i have no plaks . &quot;
they are not the elderly , but the young , who are after their decades of age , entering that subject .
when i came to the fopp , which has almost once allocated almost all for vinil , i see the witch as being very different .
there are couples , photographers , young boys and middle @-@ aged women among the ages of 70 .
it is good to see a variety of diversification among customers , although less dinging of stores ( last part of wild beast ) along with hingin and hoparadards from hoparists are contacted by sex @-@ based pop jitters instead of pepper jazz .
none of them can be particularly alone , but more than 30 seconds , creating psychological trauma that disturbed them .
the elanora ( 27 ) is travelling in the fopp for a few minutes and look at the reduced plates .
instead of spending , he has come to look only on the windows .
he says he has no choice to make a beach collection because he has not gained much .
it &apos;s very expensive .
it &apos;s easier to listen to music in computers or other forms , but the beauty of the crane is ... just like someone loves them .
i don &apos;t know how to explain i would be , in fact , without any illusions .
the last round is a post : urban outfitters , said to have inspired new generation of cranes .
when kot pantola seemed to revise them , i observe a group of young girls who gathered around the pole in polaroid cameras , prior to a debate over a father and daughter buying a cross .
with the left , jeff buckley has a full mercy with its plates , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac ; it is a fixture of an average collection ; it is a mixture of modern and childhood .
no one is believers ; maybe because these are only a decoration , some of them are untouchable .
this is a completely &quot; artistic criterion . &quot;
the wonder about these items , however , may mean that the sector can earn more money and send less customers to soho &apos;s depths ; there is not much to be a cause for complaints .
not surprisingly , it is not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time has spent more luxury items like vinil .
however , my findings suggest that yougov &apos;s results are at least correct in soho plak stores ; in the fact , they don &apos;t take into account the limelight , female collectors or crantagonists , who have been at least present , on the platform stores or at environmental forums .
they work hard in either school or at the offices .
they certainly travel the evenings in the beach stores on berwick street , reviewing their plates and fleeing through a 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake tv server for the middle @-@ aged men &apos;s shoulders , who have no knowledge of anything .

french court rejects offer to demolish shops at jungle refugee camp
a court in france rejected a proposal by calada authorities to demolish scores of makeshift shops and restaurants at the jungle camp , where thousands of refugees lived .
during this week &apos;s trial hearing , calais officials argued that the state should demolish a total of 72 makeover stores , where campaigned people from the camp sold as much products as they can buy from cigarettes or 50 cents ( 40p ) , or sold from basic dishes for a few euros .
calais valued the need to demolish these locations because they create a parallel economy for not paying taxes and because they hold risk regarding fires and hygiene .
the beneficiary groups said that shops and restaurants in the court are vital , and that it is not enough for the increasing population of the camp that the state @-@ sponsored organisations and other groups offer .
makeshift stores and restaurants argued that they often provide shelter and free food to their needed owners .
a court in lille said there was no legal anchor for the deportation of 72 makeshift stores , but the concerns of calabagis governor were &quot; totally understandable . &quot;
presiding judge jean @-@ francois molla said the heights , sightseeing , cafes and restaurants had taken a much bigger role , than just those of people living in &quot; very dangerous conditions . &quot;
these areas have been provided with comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers , she said .
for children with no profit @-@ purpose , a living in danger of demolition , jungle is offering 200 goods a dinner every day , it provides english and french courses , and there are advisers for hundreds of desperate refugees in the camp .
over 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the child &apos;s delegation .
this closure will &quot; be a facilitator for these children , some of whom are eight years old , &quot; the guardian said in a letter .
two charity institutions , help refuges and l &apos;auberge des migrants , had estimated friday that the population at the jungle camp , after rising levels during the summer , would be above 9,000 ( the highest peak to date ) .
following gold in the figtime d d d , britain took the silver medal at rugby yelanguage for the trophy championship .
the dramatic progress of great britain in the rugby 7 championship ended in the final thursday with fiji , after a 43 @-@ 7 defeat at the rio deodoro stadium .
fiji gave the chart to receive the gold medal -- the first @-@ ever olympic medalist in all colours -- pas , side action , support , colour lines and kas .
following the defeat , britain took the third silver medal of the day as a non @-@ comfort , and may now be proud of their efforts at the olympic 7 @-@ day opening tournament , which they defeated new zealand , argentina and south africa .
earlier in the day , the south african team , which they beat in the semifinals , may have found them in the final after losing 7 @-@ 5 .
however , a fixture of fixture , such as that one , might even beat a 15 @-@ member team .
maybe though not very believers , a great britain might find it somehow thinking it would take a gold medal tomorrow : fiji &apos;s chief coach , ben ryan , come from wimbledon .
it was a tough journey through the uk .
eight pathways ago , they lost every match in the seven @-@ language championship when they worked with ryan .
this time , they lost only one .
this hezimet can be a vigour , but the progress achieved is really shaming .
fiji made a fascinating start , with actors gravitating on the briton of great britain &apos;s territory .
it was like running between a series of mobile buses and a number of mobile buses , and world capital champions put the title at the osea colinisao building 5 @-@ 0 .
in the fourth minute , falry from the right @-@ wing pursuit of the jerry tuwai has another number .
the match was 12 @-@ 0 , and the great uk was virtually detached .
mitchell &apos;s great involvement prevented leone nakarawa from throwing a third of his rifle , such as the mountain , but it was only to delay the number of fifths .
in the seventh minute , jasa veremalua made the lead from the right corner , and the great britain fell 17 @-@ 0 .
with just one minute left to finish the first half , nakarawa took the reins in the world and made another number .
vatemo ravouvou then travelled down to the boundary line , cutting out of a number of formidable british interventions .
with that number , skor rose to 29 @-@ 0 .
the fiji 7 championship was a team formed to play for the title , while great britain was trying to find the groundwork yet .
the situation is more or less similar .
the great uk made big changes and closed the fibre of figy , which was a good move for four minutes , compared to the first half , to the scene , when josua tuisova perfectly performed his excellent figum .
dan norton tried one experiment for the great uk , and skoru tried to make the lead out of the left corner to make 36 @-@ 7 , but his fans were in the hands of the singing , waving flags and dancing south sea islands .
it was hard not to hear about the evil approach by fiji .
maa viliame added the last minute to them on the fij game , which had no need to decorate .
when the hit the ball , the physicians began celebrations and kept the door for the great briton to soak , which was stymiely stranded in the back .
earlier in the day , fiji beat japan 20 @-@ 5 in the semifinals , confronting south africa in a formidable semifinal ; britain took the lead with a single count .
in the first half , he cited south african team members in the south african team , but led by a number of those who made the latter in the second half .
anthony &apos;s brother marcus watson , who took part in the top 15 in britain , secured a victory and silver medal .
helen glover and heather stanones were inspired by coach &apos;s fight against cancer , knocking at the rowing event .
there will be no more emotional gold at these games , which means significant sense .
in the wake of their initial move , 220 azap cheese breaths , helen glover and heather stanning found that they could have become much more meaningful to what they underscored in stacio de lagoa .
although the two men who got rows in the boats had three shots on the boat , the voice of their coaches in the back @-@ to @-@ boarding process -- as women advance to this level in the uk this year -- was echoed by the voice of robin williams as they moved to the second gold medal in the women &apos;s pair .
their authority was quite clear -- it was their unprecedented , 39th gradedy series of defiance competitions .
although we see two wonderful athletes with breathing in the mode of motherland , this outlook does not exactly reflect the quality of the victory .
every rowing gold medal is behind the law , there is a taboo with those who are willing to make this difference , and it was not as effective as long as 30 months ago , they did not know whether they would live as long as a cancer diagnosis .
as he put it , they have touched and gone .
i caught and made it through the surface cancer that could have been interfered with surgery .
if they don &apos;t do so , they go everywhere .
it would be bad .
this slightly changed your viewpoint .
he had been identified in december 2013 .
apart from the season , the three were very good luckily , since they were able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , and in such situations it would be unknown , but in this way , to hesitate .
for this reason , i would not have been required to pay , so i would have to quickly improve it .
it was an incentive for me .
i was in hospital and i said that a few steps were enough , but i went up in the garden at 6 , 9 , 15 metres away .
that way it started .
getting a cross is a journey by itself , but it is a bit larger .
in the wake of his victory , he was in williams , who had a tense morning in order to deal with his own concerns .
&quot; i was emotionally destroyed this week emotionally , maybe it &apos;s a little bit more than that , but with great value , &quot; said stanning , who came to afghanistan earlier this week .
it means what it means to me , and it is more important how much work the helen , ben and robin , i emphasise .
i spent three years with helen and robin .
i would like to convey my greatest motivation to him , because we were not a rocket , so i would not have the best coach in the world .
i could not find a better person or a better coach to work .
helen glover and heather stanning have not lost the race for five years .
the two have met a tough line that cannot reach opponents .
even during the last 500 metres , when new zealand and the danish teams closed the site , the strength of stanning and glover had yet to be exhausted .
we missed ourselves .
helen was watching the process , followed by izle &apos; .
it is really important not to be gone .
we had a good start and did not try to do something incredible .
we didn &apos;t expect the explosion of fireworks today , we didn &apos;t expect to win the race , which we got only good rowing .
the two will hold a year &apos;s break before deciding what to do in the future .
glover has a wedding that should join next month ; he and his tv adventurer , steve bacl , are in the spotlight .
for the time being , he wants to enjoy that .
i did not want to say that this was my last race .
they would have put pressure on too many .
i did not realise that i was an olympic champion in london .
that was a huge number of newcomers , and i was very stressful .
it lasted about four minutes .
that is a much better enthusiasm , &quot; he said .

bulgaria announces inflation rate for the first time in eight months .
monthly inflation in bulgaria was at 1 % in june , according to national statistics .
this is the highest value in years -- since june 2012 -- but it was the first appreciation of zero since october , following a positive rate of 0.2 % last year .
lower than average inflation in the last 12 months ( august 2015 - july 2016 ) for the cpi , was 0.8 % , compared to the previous 12 months ( august 2014 - july 2015 ) .
by comparison , the consumer price index in july 2007 was 101.0 % , compared to 1.0 % .
since the beginning of the year , the inflation rate has been about 0.2 % -- comparing july 2016 to december 2015 -- and the monthly inflation gap between july 2016 and july 2015 was 0.2 % .
compared to the previous month , in july 2016 , the price hike was observed in consumer product groups : food and non @-@ alcohol ( 1.7 % ) , transportation ( 1.3 % ) , entertainment and culture ( 6.3 % ) , restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) , various services and hotels ( 0.3 % ) .
clock and shoe ( 2.2 % ) slipped in furniture , furniture , household equipment and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) and healthcare ( 0.1 % ) groups .

snapchat &apos;s &quot; anonymity &quot; criticised as asian caricature
while snapchat said it was inspired by the extraditions for this fleet , some observers say it is racial .
the snapchat allows it to play with ids at an absurdity level , changing the reality of around 150m users every day .
you can turn itself into a paradox anasa , a village located from the scene of a roy lichtenstein painting .
merceler is repercussions that connects more than 30 million people every day .
the wrong steps are at the hands of the fast @-@ paced camp .
snapchat mercedes faced charges in the past that have supported or believers in the implementation , or as the beautifully written guarantor &apos;s tongue .
therefore , some critics criticised the company for having a &quot; asian mask &quot; that wrongdoing the lions , which this week offered them , made them pregnant , bumpy and inflated .
and they would wonder if the recurring conflicts point to a bigger problem regarding the diversification of the company .
reports and outrage said that the reports and motherland on wednesday spread through the information and motherboards , and the day later they removed the snapcat .
in a statement , the company issued a statement : compulsory for anonymity , not for the designation to be caroused .
for observers with racism experiment , however , the body reminded of the vibrant stereotypes .
others have generally rejected the comparison to the motherland .
grace sparapani , an american art student of korean origin and a tweet who wrote about the photos , said the bullet in an e @-@ mail was &quot; the most disturbing and disturbing statement . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult for the discussion to compare the notorious asian caricature to side @-@ by @-@ side , &quot; he added .
this shows that the fleet is not only an asian mask , but also a degrading noise .
the snapchat is not the only company to have sophisticated cultural mechanisms .
the american culture seems to be at an endless conflict regarding diversity and confiscation of various fields , from the institutions &apos; meeting room to hollywood , and all of them .
and one can see that there is room for greater sensitivity among young people , who have a greater diversity of race than other opponents .
katie zhu , 25 , said in an interview thursday that when the snapchat forms a small banner for one user , &quot; it is much more difficult to realise that kind of moves are not being noticed as before . &quot;
on thursday , woman zhu , a product manager and engineer who worked for medium , decided to cut his account for the snapchat and called for everyone to do so .
in an article and a phone interview for medium , he said he believes the interethnic conflict reflects the diversification of employment practices in snapchat .
she criticised the company &apos;s leading team of white men , ending her article with a label : sneak tish .
&quot; because there are no different kinds of ethnicities among their staff , they can make such decisions or make people of different ethnicities that work there and are people from different ethnicities , so they don &apos;t feel secure enough or comfortable , &quot; said the woman , who is of chinese origin .
other observers share his view about the complaint that the snapchat left largely unanswered .
the company does not share the figures on diversification among its personnel , highlighting the state of private company .
on thursday , he refused to share the racial origins of the snapt staff , but according to a spokesman , the company had recently contributed a recruitment responsibility for boosting the need for populism and inclusion .
for her own point , she said she will keep the snapchat account closed , adding that &quot; i wonder if this is necessary for more users , like us , that it is right . &quot;
congressional panel says military officials falsely woo intelligence
a congress paneli said in a report released on thursday that he was evaluating intelligence reports to draw more optimistic attention to the actions of the united states of the united states in the fight against the islamic state in iraq and syria .
a interconnector report from a working column on the military service committee , the intelligence committee and the heads of the republican committee for defence , found that their superiors were &quot; a widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among central command analysts , who said that the us forces had changed the assessments of the islamic state .
known as centcom , it is a military headquarters at the central command , tampa , fla . that controls us army operations in the middle east and central asia .
&quot; the intelligence results that have been confirmed by the senior centcom leaders show more positive results than the fact in the field of preventing terrorism in the first place , and constantly offer more positive results than the analysis of other motives of the intelligence community , &quot; the report said .
&quot; what &apos;s going on in centcom is unacceptable ; our warriors have suffered their frustration while presenting bad analysis to high @-@ level decision @-@ making authorities , &quot; says calvert , a representative of the californitarian republican representative .
failure in centcom reached the organisation &apos;s highest levels .
the 10 @-@ page report also detained permanent problems in 2014 and 2015 , as part of the central command &apos;s explanation and analysis of american training for iraqi forces .
no matter how far it has been said that the late obama administration officials exchanged orders to change the reports , but leaders of the centred were presently pressured to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the work of the islamic state , which is also known as the force &apos;s day and daiz .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central komut press remark , baby and congress exchanged significantly more applicable to actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a centcom official has indicated that a large military attack could be conducted at a time as early as april or may 2015 , in order to put the public out open to mosul .
iraq &apos;s second largest city , musoul , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; in the wake of several months of research , this was clearly understood , &quot; said mike pompeo , the deputy republican representative of kansas .
the most senior intelligence leaders of the united states , from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , have manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence results in a move that could deal with the threat posed by the id in iraq .
republications established a working arm after learning analysts that information on the islamic state is manipulated .
as further inspections continue , the report published on thursday will be far more comprehensive .
another centcom intelligence is being conducted by the general inspector of the defence ministry .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee also released their own findings thursday , participating in some of the results of the republican working arm .
&quot; the establishment of a very small process in terms of intelligence concerning the centcom , co @-@ operation and the iraqi security forces between 2014 and 2015 , &quot; said the chairman of the committee &apos;s democratic representative , adam bschiff .
according to mr. schiff , the process &quot; has delayed the publication of intelligence results , &quot; analysts have raised the morale of morale and &quot; does not adequately include the opposing positions . &quot;
but mr. schiff and democrats said they did not reach a finding suggesting that the white house exercised pressure on centcom analysts to set the consequences &quot; predetermined or politically . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress review were announced by the daily beast on tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that a pentagon inspector general , which was launched after complaints by centcom analysts .
as a pentagon spokesman , senior commander patrick evans said he would not comment on the defence ministry &apos;s congress report in the process of reviewing the general inspectorate .
however , he said , &quot; experts might be at odds in some cases over interpretation of complex data , and have said that the ministry of intelligence and the defence supports healthy dialogue regarding this important national security considerations . &quot;
beyond the issue of whether the us @-@ led bombing in iraq and syria proceeds the proceeds . ( this is a case every day carried out by more defence officials ) .
last year &apos;s accusations , however , raised questions about how much president obama could count on central command for the honest assessment of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis points .
criticism about reflecting the reflects islamic state intelligence , centcom intelligence analyst gregory hooker wrote an article saying that president george w. bush &apos;s administration should maintain a small force in iraq , despite many analysts , and that he did not consider its occupation after 2003 , and has been under discussion for more than ten years .
mr. hooker played an important role in the uprising against the islamic state intelligence .
the attacks against the establishments owned by mr. hooker &apos;s team against the islamic state , although they put forward last year &apos;s public statements , have concluded that the terrorist group &apos;s financial resources are not substantially affected , as it has built temporary repressions to sell oil in the black refinery in karabort , officials concluded .
however , the finding has not been taken out of command , as the times said in september .
centcom &apos;s statement last year was met with criticism by then @-@ sister general lloyd j. austin iii , who cited several laws in the senate as an extremely positive assessment of the war .
general austin has retired in april and the central command replaced by general joseph l. votel .
as the us women &apos;s team prepared to face the united kingdom , the us women &apos;s team won the reins 4 victory over the backdrop .
one day after winning three goals in a 6 @-@ 1 victory over japan , katie bam scored the first two goals for the united american women &apos;s cement management team , which beat india 3 @-@ 0 on thursday .
although it appeared to require a permanent five @-@ goal mask in two matches , the father ( 27 ) said he was not sure if he would do the same before .
&quot; i have no idea , &quot; he said .
i am not the people who keep track of their goals .
speaking , the americans share the top four @-@ 0 in the olympic tournament and first place in the group with britain , which fell in decoration thursday after defeating japan 2 @-@ 0 .
britain and the united states will face each other in the final round saturday .
both teams won the quarterfinals for the quarterfinals , and the match will determine who will finish the group &apos;s matches with six teams .
the team that won the group &apos;s matches , but will not face some for a little longer with the powerful dutch team , the leader of another group that started the quarterfinals .
following saturday &apos;s match , however , americans made significant progress in the wake of the london olympics , where they were last among 12 teams .
bam was that team .
she grew up at blue bell , pa . ; she was first only 3 when she took the house of sophia ( ikiz ables ) and was the youngest player for the national team at the 16 @-@ year @-@ old team in drexel .
she missed the 2008 olympics due to her failure to qualify for the last woman .
it came in 2012 , after which many had gone undone for him and his teammates .
the following year , a british coach , craig parnham , was inaugurated and things started to change .
&quot; cultural change , a mentality change , a physical change , &quot; my father says .
we are no longer working as in london .
we were completely transformed .
on thursday night , my father took the first leg of his life into a closely @-@ circumstance , and the first half the first .
although the team had not yet won a victory , it managed to maintain the score -- 1 @-@ 0 -- until the third quarter , when the father activated .
he made a comedy with his hand from the left , then reshuffled to the ball and threw it in the ball , which he said made the americals 2 @-@ 0 .
melissa gonzales scored last goal towards the fourth quarter .
it was the first time us goalkeeper jackie briggs , whose first three victories allowed them to score a goal .
his chances were announced .
so is my father .
&quot; we are now in a good place , &quot; parnham said . &quot; but it depends on how good this location is , &quot; he added .
tragedy in the middle of olympic ambitions
whatever is , the olympics are still taking place , regardless of how long is it .
rio de janeiro represents a rivalry and a study that thrilling , and it can never be finished or avoided .
the olympic torch , like a gymnast spurred on the gymnast , was put out of the gymnast and a gymnast .
you can &apos;t watch television without hearing anything about the feud billing between simone biles , katic or michael phelps and clos , or can &apos;t listen to what you have been a long way to your neighbour at a café .
and there is also the logan dooley .
a gammering heart attack -- like a swimmer , a gymnast or a fencer -- could be one of the names during the day of prime time , among tv advertisements making the first laureate , sponsors and self @-@ censorship good .
however , lake forest is vying for the gold medal at the olympic games , in which california &apos;s mr. dooley ( 28 ) .
the olympic alevi event does not provide an equal light .
the centre has sports that in part don &apos;t get universally recognised in the shade : air rifle shooting , archery , badminton , teklido .
always , it will be us to form a rule , and always wishes for a long time to come .
however , i would like to point out that i like to see what i like , for example , a secret to which i would like to draw attention .
although known as an olympic event since 2000 , when both the trambolin sydney games were presented , few in the 16 years did not realise it was an olympic sport .
this could be a regional corpse .
although the united states has sent its athletes for the competition , it has never won a medal in its tram , and has never been a contestant who reached the finals until 2012 .
in men &apos;s events , the awards were for chinese and russian , while in the women trainees and cannabis shared .
rosie maclennan of china and canada will seek to protect the gold medals they received in london this year .
but trambolin tougher as an event , which in part can be attributed to the fact that she is a recogator at the palyaco school , instead of the olympics .
i should admit that i was not a specialist here , but i have only plenty to do .
the comic potential is there -- it reflects the throne of two sports -- gymnastics and the skulls -- which it provided in the form of a cartoon such as the cartoon , which has created an endemic pot that has never been finished .
the term &quot; trambolin , &quot; which comes from spanish words , makes it &quot; trample , &quot; meaning &quot; trample . &quot;
the event &apos;s candidates are situated to an almost 30 fite high at a large tram , and are being asked to carry out a series of actions ( scholarships , pipe and salto ) before they take their feet over .
according to the official olympic programme , they are assessed according to executive , hard time and &quot; flight subsidies . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , including 16 men and 16 women , will compete in rio .
the most frequent progress ever made at the olympics is direct .
those who hope to win medals should end up in some cases in search of gold , and in some cases , they should go back , with more or less moves taken , faster and higher .
not only did they follow the finish line or the initial wall , but at the same time on tv , there is another difficult line on the broadcast ; the world is the olympic record .
this endeavour is is in the asil , gentle , and even in extreme levels , and it is sufficient to drown a crowd of teeth .
however , it is exactly what i &apos;ve found , as i follow the games .
trambolin provides the right to give you all that at a time .
those who are trafficked are upper move .
the goal is not to move forward .
the upper axis , astronauts such as astronaut , is more appealing to the upper interest , more or less .
of course , whether competition or difficulties is not going to happen during the routine , but there is no glimpse to achieve the outcome of the routine , there is no loss to salvation . just like time , where the submission will be suspended in an unthinkable way .
regardless of how high a olympic race can be dinghip .
the women &apos;s rankings and the finals will be held in the afternoon of friday afternoon , with the men again in 13 on saturday .
the nbc will issue the finals in both days , up from 14,00 , as a bloc .
in the middle of their olympic madness , they promise a silent and wonderful moment that can be ignored in general brawl .
and if the united states , according to the wall street journal , offers men more to satisfy and exclude just as men &apos;s gypsies had recently proposed , we can say that mr. dooley expects new fans .
&quot; a generation of protests &quot; in ethiopia , a longtime us ally
violence @-@ based protests in ethiopia
protesters who demanded political change in ethiopia have faced fierce resistance from the government .
he says a large number of protesters have taken lethal arms coups in clashes with police .
is ethiopia about to collapse ?
over the past ten years , african economy has been one of the most stable nations in the region and a solid ally of the west , with its economy growing rapidly .
however , anti @-@ government protests in recent months have shaken up the country , spreading more tentacles to other regions .
last week alone , thousands took to the streets to demand basic political changes .
according to human rights groups , the government &apos;s reaction to it was extremely painful .
the police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed demonstrators , he said .
security officials break their hands and stand by the wall after a rally that was believed to have taken place at the end of last year or early this year . &#91; officials of the security forces &#93;
at the highest level , the un human rights official would like to see a thorough review .
&quot; it has always been hard to keep this country together , and moving forward will be much more difficult , &quot; said rashid abdi , project director at the international crisis group &apos;s somalia peninsula , a research group .
ethiopia is the country &apos;s population of the top nations after nigeria and is appreciated by the west .
the us military and intelligence services are working closely with ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region , especially somalia , and there is very few countries in africa that have received help from the west .
ethiopia &apos;s economy is growing impressive .
infrastructure has been improved effectively ; a new suburban rail would be located in the capital , addis ababa .
and their streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
although the latter has not always shown the best example of democracy in ethiopia , ( human rights groups constantly referred to the government &apos;s oppressive attitude ) , opposition within the country was extremely restricted , with opponents being effective .
most were sent to exile , imprisonment , slaughter or closest corners .
but that could be for change .
sejoum teshome , a university professor from central ethiopia , said &quot; if you are suffocating people and don &apos;t give them other options than the protest , they interest . &quot;
youth is in total protest .
one generation protest .
there are many complaints , ranging from land use to pressure on the power of the ruling coalition .
following last year &apos;s highly critical election , the ruling party and its allies also received their last arm of filling opponents and can now control 100 per cent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions on the border with eritrevri , which led to the war in june that killed hundreds of people , and the conflict on the border has increased .
analysts fear that separatist groups , such as the oromo freedom front or the ogaden national freedom front , in recent years will be eliminated from this type of blasts and weapons .
there is a few factors which , for years , explains why hard @-@ line feelings have been growing .
first , he appears innocent : wise phones .
a large number of ethiopians began contact the country &apos;s social media just a few years ago , as cheap phones can be promoted and internet service funded .
although the government had banned access to facebook and twitter , especially as it often used to during the protests , most were able to communicate via internet you who hide their position .
a few young ethiopians said they were gathering in this way for the protests .
secondly , solidarity among the two major ethnic groups in ethiopia -- the orthodox and ambulances -- has increased .
the orthodox and amusements are not normally allies .
for too long , ambulances in the mountaineering mountaineering mountaineering and operating mountaineers in ethiopia &apos;s predominantly christian mountaineering mountaineers have been implicated in what is mostly muslim .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are going forward to gather under an umbrella and to co @-@ operate , &quot; said mulatu gemechu , an oromo leader .
the biggest protests were held in the amhara and oromo areas .
most of them amhara and oromo think ethiopia was divided by members of the military , intelligence services , trade and policy @-@ making tigram ethnic group , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population .
the third cause of the insurgency was the death of meles zenawi .
he served as prime minister of ethiopia for 17 years , until 2012 , from an unidentified disease to an undisclosed illness .
it was thought to be a tactic detection that everyone would not see .
analysts say he is especially specialised in identifying the initial signs of discontent and integrating opponents .
&quot; the current regime does not have this basic knowledge , &quot; said conflict analyst bay abdi .
the new prime minister of ethiopia , hailemarius desaln , was chosen in unambiguity to fill in mr. meles .
mr. meles from the tigray region of north ethiopia , unlike mr. haili , is south .
analysts say he has failed to gain security confidence in the security services that the tithers control .
as a result , further fear took place .
his last experience of this kind of turnaround was the protest in 2005 following thieves by thousands of people following the government &apos;s rebellion .
although more than a month ago , many protesters were killed and have gone faster than last month when measures to arise this confusion .
development experts commended ethiopia &apos;s leaders for significant progress in harbouring infrastructure , such as the new one , and the fight against poverty .
it is clear , however , that this has not halted the validity of enthusiasm towards the ethiopian government .
and this is a dangerous and ethnically motivated situation .
last month , protesters at gondar , a town in the town of amhara , attacked businesses owned by tigrades and projected to a rise in the social media .
analysts say the protests left other allies in the united states and the west strange .
the us government used ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft on neighbouring somalia , but was recently said to have been closed .
although the west wants to promote democracy , it does not want its ally in a frail @-@ out area to be torn apart .
&quot; this is just us , &quot; he said . &quot; it &apos;s like to walk on a very substantially too late . &quot;
donald trump cites obama &apos;s claim that he had cofounded id as &quot; deception &quot;
donald j. trump tried to remove the last conflict around the campaign , insisting last week that president obama and hillary clinton have been serious of the islamic state terrorist group &apos;s &quot; founders . &quot;
his statement raised new questions about the reputational candidate &apos;s ability to publicly communicate with the american people .
at the same time , it has put mps in a strange position in the process of trying to explain what they can do to defend him in the complicated process .
mr. trump insisted that after recommending that at a rally wednesday night , he had more reinforced his resolution thursday , implying that she and her woman , clinton , actually established the initiative .
however , mr trump was quoted as telling reporters through twitter early friday morning .
the reference showed that mr. trump completely backed off the charge in a series of interviews , a day before .
conservative radio show hugh hewitt says he does not believe in this , as mr. trump tried to help him relax that interpretation .
mr. trump has emerged as he attempts to change the campaign following a decline in the polls .
mr. trump and women &apos;s clinton spoke with each other about the economy in michigan this week .
on friday , mr. trump again sought to turn to the issue .
also speaking via twitter , she said her offers would be taxes on women &apos;s bids and that she would have hardened her speech .
mr. trump has previously used his defence .
in late july , after having met with strong criticism after the russian proposals to launch a pirated attack on clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails in the event of a piration , &quot; of course , i said that , &quot; i should have told this in a deception . &quot;
this approach ensures mr. trump to force political convergence of political conversations and retract the needed location .
ruth sherman , a communications expert who monitors the language used by both candidates , said &quot; it is a order to make a &quot; statement &quot; depending on how certain messages react by those who supported him .
at the same time , however , he speaks knowing his words and finds it as unclear as to the filmgoers when it comes to different currencies .
mr. trump , after being recently decreasing in the polls , took a much more aggressive stance , rather than softening the mood for the general election audience .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marketi , released on friday , showed that mr. trump is behind the northern corner , virginia and colorado , and that she is in a tight race in florida .
although she refrains the apology for provocative things usually said the trumpet , she has accused her of diverting the critics &apos; promises or failing to understand his morals .
but mr trump &apos;s publicity , which has suffered much more scrutiny in the last months of the presidential campaign , has proved difficult to lure its staunch supporters if his comments were inflaming public .
in an interview with cnn , former mayor rudolph w. giuliani of new york city , made his best to defend the island at cnn on thursday , as one of the most prominent motives in mr. trump .
asked about the accuracy of mr. trump &apos;s scheme that mr. obama and clinton established the islamic state , mr. giuliani said &quot; i think it is a legitimate , political critic . &quot;
in some respects , the id was a small group that was not before obama , it was a subjected to them completely faithful and this was due to the withdrawal of its soldiers from iraq .
many critics argue that her administration , as foreign minister , has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the middle east and has left it with the office of the secretary @-@ general .
ahead of friday &apos;s rallies in pennsylvania , trump twitter continues to press the news on its own for every word , blaming and contempt .
&quot; they cannot do that ! &quot; he said , alluding to tv experts , who tried to solve him .
some democrats , mourning their leg by mr. trump , said it was evidence that he was not eligible for the post .
once elmed up with prices in cafe greenpoinvest , which once turned out to be elusive
he was offering great coffee for 15 years , although verb xhafe wi @-@ fi , a former dish working only with cash in williamsburg .
naturally , he could not cope with prices at his stores in bedford avenue .
they are also sold to a soap cherie kap kek , who replaced verb in the summer of 2014 .
some people in the region don &apos;t know that this is the last loss of the negotiable city .
&quot; new york is a change , i know , &quot; he wrote to molly crabaple . &quot; i know , this , however , that cbgb is gone and chelsea is being evacuated and i cannot believe that verb is a store now . &quot;
but new york is the city to restart as much as change .
a newly renovated verb cafe was launched in greenpoint last november , less than a million away from its original position .
the new everb has a cafe wi @-@ fi connection and acknowledges a credit card , but preserves some former workers and the simple tone .
coffee is still good .
cisco rodriguez , the owner and director of the new station , is the new location for long @-@ term employees .
he joined the verb in 2001 and until the very end .
one customer said he would be excited when he offered the funding for this new location .
mr. rodriguez ( 36 ) , many left the same .
verb uses the same distributor for the registry , and bought an espresso machine from the same model .
even the lights of the old verb were reinstated there .
but mr. rodriguez said he wants to offer some varied experiences .
new ingredients were added .
the packaging and egg @-@ and @-@ cheese sandwichers also offer materials , such as back @-@ and @-@ thumb , on board .
esmer @-@ pirinic coffins exist .
the cafe is no longer doing the beer service , but it offers fresh fruits .
nine months later , mr. rodriguez said he realised the former designers were starting to come forward decisively .
&quot; many of our former clients could not cope with the prices in williamsburg , &quot; he said .
last sunday , recca olira was among those customers .
she lives in williamsburg , where she was often headed to verb .
he didn &apos;t stop moving to greenpoint , even after he moved to the green line .
after the closure , verb said he chose to drink coffee for a period of time .
&quot; i noticed that what i loved was a coffee and culture in verb , &quot; she said .
now he has started drinking coffee , but the last day he chose a new pipe with his regular ice brown instead .
another patron , tom rosenthal , travelled regularly to verb starting in 2003 .
she was there before and gave the order .
&quot; every day , i had entered the oath of seven , i had no shock , i was well and every day they had prepared a transcript order of the edge order , &quot; she said .
photo mr. rodriguez said he wants to make a change and he added the menu to new materials .
nowadays , mr. rosenthal is still taking his order at all times , at a certain change in its own hands by adding to each day &apos;s symposium , egg and cheese .
mr. rodriguez said he was not constructing to smuggle store , which replaced the old venue .
judging by his mind , the owners of soap cherie offered to do a special diet for the tax using a coffee that had encircled into the head of the cafe .
&quot; i think that we can still accept this offer , &quot; mr. rodriguez said .
and many of greenpointe &apos;s traditional polish residents embraced it .
one of the new customers was able to translate the menu into leukemia , and mr. rodriguez said his new neighbours would soon find an area to demonstrate that origin so they can feel good .
the new position has other advantages .
the local jubilee water store is trying to inject and sell the cold debris .
the café is likely to spread across the building in the t @-@ shirt building .
for most customers , it is only necessary that a new verb be available , if they find the old favourites .
joseph whitt was a regular customer and was so sorry after the shutdown .
when the newly opened venue , mr. whitt said he felt like to go in and buy coffee at his house .
&quot; i had to put it out , &quot; he said .
time of crisis , lowing to &quot; a square meal &quot; in his book
in march 1933 , franklin delano roosevelt was at the oval office , just after she held the post of president .
one sank to the bosphorus , president roosevelt , loved the flooded fighter , such as the sandwichine and maryland kaplumpin , was likely to enjoy the vegetables .
the origin of that sunday &apos;s menu was much more modest : pyramid @-@ sampled eggs , potatoes and pessimistic powder .
&quot; it was an act of solidarity with those who have suffered hardship , &quot; jane ziegelman said .
his wife , andrew , added : &quot; this was also a message to americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who lives in brooklyn heights , is a meal historian .
mr. coe &apos;s latest book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; was likely to be heard of chinese cuisine in america , and in her book &quot; 97 orchard , &quot; it exchanged life in the lower east region in the region of orchard .
&quot; a square meal , &quot; a new book she works together and will be published by harper on tuesday , perceiving the history of american foods during the great depression .
themselves , they have demonstrated solidarity with the meal , meeting with a reporter for the meal of eisenberg sandvic in the area of flatiron , which has become part of the crisis since 1929 , when the crisis began .
female ziegelman ( 54 ) , krem peynli and zeytinli sandvic order , while mr. coe ( 57 ) preferred to take the reins , potatoes , potatoes and vegetables .
the couple found the reporter &apos;s order in rulo coal to be discussed with crisis dishes .
&quot; they were very popular , &quot; said the woman &apos;s ziegelman .
the venue had its blunted sound , jewellery , beans and beans powder .
these were cheap things that spread the material with a material .
imagine you eat enough space at dinner .
mr. coe put his face on the surface .
&quot; one should have seated as a bullet , &quot; he said .
in the years leading up to the crisis , basics in the countryside in the countryside area , especially in the countryside , were open @-@ ended .
they were cooking for men working at the farm and served with cooking cuisine , lunch food and dinner food .
americans were sending foods to the europeans who died of hunger during world war i . &quot; a square meal &quot; explains the history of how the nation could soon be a centre for extinction .
&quot; this was a time when the dinner became a central , alarming anxiety for the americans , &quot; the mr coe said , announcing the reasons for his and her wife &apos;s call to write about the issue .
the new budget regime was equally worrying : hearings such as somunitions and vegetables became a main product of configuration , and women &apos;s ziegelman was &quot; great method for evaluating the remaining dishes &quot; and deceiving equipment to underpin a kres .
drives were placed on the site of fresh fruit , which is cheaper .
a meat found at the centre of us food for many years became a luxurious luxury .
the interesting martial mixture , or the general happiness , was offended by interesting mixture for the value of thorny and nutrient .
the woman &apos;s ziegelman researched for her book , which also included the recipes , while refrigerating the refrigerator from that period in a scam oven baked in the goddess .
&quot; this dinner table was not a popular contribution on the table , &quot; he said .
the woman &apos;s ziegelman supported it . &quot; this fact was true . &quot;
there are no common points in the oven shower &apos;s oven .
most home economies situated in their fields .
experts from the house economy , including louise stanley , who heads the federal house economy office , led the country &apos;s diet habits from 1923 to 1943 as never before .
screening and articles published in newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to be &quot; saving spirituality , &quot; and promoting the fight to turn the match into leukemia for leukemia @-@ swirled food , such as cart spagetti .
the &quot; a square meal &quot; is a non @-@ historic feast .
the responses given by president herbert hoover to the government &apos;s hungry citizens , such as the upset on my cake , were very exceptional .
he paid tribute to public foothills such as millionaire mill , while at the same time turning it into millionaire .
&quot; he loved europe cuisine , such as a societal fish on an epidemic , &quot; he said .
their food was plausible in the ceremonial room , where they used to wear the vegetables in the dinner and dinner .
it was extremely far from reality .
his wife , eleanor , could have come to the same line , though he could not encourage him to be an example with midesi .
according to the book , the woman began offering only the &quot; most backward food &quot; set up at the white house , when roosevelt recruited a man who never cared about lezeline , but also the most notorious coffins .
after the country was re @-@ unrest , most of the ways of making a meal during the crisis are put aside .
according to her woman , ziegelman , understanding of calorphan and nutrient understanding and the way science is applied to food .
at the time of the book , the couple said that in his writing , she had learned a lot from the eating habits of her mother , kissing food -- for example , never to foot the meal .
&quot; the food waste name was really terrible , &quot; he said .
the woman &apos;s ziegelman spoke about his former memories : &quot; really people are sick , &quot; she said .
there were cases of feasting garbage .
after gathering tables in eisenberg , he and mr. took a taste of a house @-@ prepared taste : the dried taste that president roosevelt gave in his lunch &apos;s lunch .
&quot; the peculiar dry @-@ boarded for it , &quot; she added , adding that the most frequent feat was to give an apiece to these modest fields .
he didn &apos;t have the discount ; he was just a bit blind , some un , sugar , water and fields .
everybody hesitant to cluster in a coffee shop that makes blood feuding .
it was not surprising .
he received the coe , the second , and third .
&quot; it would be good part of a bit of snake that would have come down , &quot; his wife , like someone who could have been witnessing .

hillary clinton announced on friday the tax statement of the democrats &apos; presidential candidate and wife won $ 10.75m last year and showing they paid 34.2 per cent in force , 34.2 per cent less than in taxes .

clinton &apos;s friend , the us senator , virginia , published a 10 @-@ year tax statement with her husband , anne holton .
in 2015 , they paid a 20.3 per cent federal taxes .
&quot; hillary clinton and tim kaine remain the standard for financial transparency , &quot; said clinton campaign agent jennifer palmieri .
by contrast , donald trump has been rounding off on commitments made before in which his tax statements were made , putting them back and booming .
it is a tradition that , no matter how long the laws are required , us presidential candidates present their tax statements open to the public .
trump and lawyers , a businessperson from new york , said that the reason for the rejection of the statements was a control conducted by the administration of the revenues .
in conjunction with the democratic candidate &apos;s statements , clinton campaign officer ian sams put the tweeth in &quot; tweets . &quot;
on thursday , trump &apos;s acting special case michael cohen said that the tra will not allow cnn to publish them until the surveillance is complete .
the group criticised the trust , which also includes the republican candidates for president in 2012 , mitrovica romney and other republications , voiced questions about the essence of the situation , its contribution to charity institutions , business deals and many other links with russia .
clinton appeared on friday after an online video of the top republics that showed them exercising pressure on trump over explanation .
on thursday , in an economic speech in michigan , he expressed the problem .
he told the crowd &quot; he has refused to publish the tax statements , &quot; where he told them &quot; every candidate has done for a number of decades . &quot;
politico said the tra had paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s , and on friday , a new york times business department columnist and accountant said the situation could still continue .
federal tax rates have become a major challenge in the presidential election .
clinton presented a rule proposal to name billionaire investor warren buffetet , which would have at least 30 per cent pay taxes per year over $ 1m .
obama supports the offer .
last week , at a clinton rally in nebraska , omaha , the berkshire hathawawaj group was already there , challenging the visit to buffett , trump and the tax statement .
he said he was passing through monitoring , and that trump is &quot; afraid &quot; of voters , not from the tax collection institution .
clinton published tax statements until 2007 on the campaign .
clinton family , currently living in new york , chappaqua , paid an average rate of about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 , and the combined tax rate reaches about 40.5 per cent .
clinton &apos;s family is in a statement for 2015 , indicating that , most of them amercannabis , only $ 100 per cent of their income is paid .
ana investments are a low @-@ cost index investment fund , and the clinton family declared that the temetiness and interest income are $ 10,000 .

toz red pepper kons have been supporting the protection of films in tanzania , kestane showers .
environmentalists in tanzania use an unusual method to prevent the filters from entering human settlement ; they put them in containers full of red peppers .
the method proved to be effective , and the honeyguide foundation , a us @-@ based union for conservation with the east was taking steps to promote it ; in the villages of northern tanzania , volunteers began training on using four @-@ step methods that do not harm their homes and crops .
before , many used locally to defend themselves .
on friday , the world day of fil is dedicated to the protection of animals .
&quot; we have seen that since our car was developed , the stance in those communities has changed , and now there is greater confidence in the ability to keep the fleet off the land without damaging it , &quot; said damian bell , executive director of honey .
the first two steps include keeping the fencing and honouring flavour .
if this is impossible , what is called &quot; red pepper bulutu &quot; is being codenamed .
drapper toz red pepper , holding a keeper &apos;s hearth , closes only on the merits and shootings , as you have to show up in the air .
when it is burned , he reopened with an explosion and enjoys red pepper habit .
even a brewer can afford to send his fleet to the opposite .
the last resort is to a logic , which has caused a loud , brilliant explosion that sent air to the air .
the jewish filmmaker was hit by a shootout on the shoot in berlin , which froze israel &apos;s telephone code over the &apos; demand &apos; given the country &apos;s &quot; expired &quot; -- rt news .
a jewish french film producer , in berlin , has sparked media sensationalism after revealing that the kempinski bristol hotel has failed to list israel &apos;s telephone code , and that the worker put forward his &quot; demands &quot; by arab customers .
claude lanzmann , author of the documentary &quot; shoah &quot; on genocide , voiced his outrage at the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin with an open letter to the german broadcaster faz .
lanzmann tried to find israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel in the recent fortnight .
however , the country was not among the states that could be subject to direct arrest from the chamber .
how can the new german capital be ruined and destroyed in berlin , berlin ?
lanzmann wrote .
instead , kempinski bristol allows israel to search through its own hotline .
the filmmaker reported a reception at the hotel &apos;s reception in order to get a statement .
the response was &quot; shocked , &quot; lanzmann wrote .
the hotel &apos;s secretary described the measure as a &quot; deliberate decision of the kempinski @-@ hotels administration . &quot;
the rationale for this move was caused by far more synergy with film producers .
&quot; the majority of our guests asked for the write @-@ off of the arab and israeli housewives , &quot; he said .
according to suddeutsche zeitung , the israeli ambassador to germany , jakov hadas @-@ handelsman , described the situation as a &quot; great shameful . &quot;
we were horrified and very surprised .
it &apos;s really a shameful shame .
it is a far greater reality that this was done in germany and in such a hotel chain .
there is no need for that to be followed .
we are waiting for the hotel to identify with the necessary outcome , &quot; he said .
the incident has sparked a sharp response in the online environment ; people have described it as a scandal .
some accused kempinski hotel of &quot; succumbing &quot; to the alleged demands of arab clients .
another reference was &quot; utopia &quot; by highlighting the hotel near a synagogue , in which it was found on kurfurstendamm street .
according to der spiegel , the hotel said it was the result of &quot; lack of attention &quot; and was apologised to lanzmann to shoot the accusations at the &quot; speedy . &quot;
a representative of kedeutsche zeitung said there was &quot; no direct order not to enter the list of israel &apos;s swift search for the country . &quot;
and she said that they have now added cobblestone .
police use pepper spray , plastic bullet against brazilian protesters
students gathered in the brao pauli town of sao paulo , brazil on thursday to demonstrate the government &apos;s opposition to reforms on the public education system .
police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the problem began with the fact that police officers tried to disperse the students , which prompted the police to use rubber bullets and pepper gas .
hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to voice their dissatisfaction with the plans .
according to a proposal by sao director geraldo alckin , less than 100 public schools will be shut down for savings , and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools .
some of the protesters were found to have written walls against temporary president michel temer .
the last protest came only days after protesters went out in the streets to support the proposed presidential language rousseff , which was removed from office by the country &apos;s senate .
russia and iran trade rises to 71 % -- rt business
according to russian ambassador to iran levan dzhagaryan , the trade turnover between moscow and tehran grew by 70.9 % year @-@ on @-@ year .
ever since the international sanctions against iran were lifted , the interest of russian companies doing business in the country increased sharply , he said .
as new companies prepare to provide access to the market , russian companies are maintaining existing ties with iran .
of course , increased trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral co @-@ operation with iran , &quot; he said .
in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between russia and iran increased by 70.9 % compared to the same period in 2015 , and reached $ 856m , said .
in particular , russian exports to iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $ 697m .
russian imports from iran rose 16 per cent to $ 158m .
&quot; this increase in trade was provided with machinery , flock @-@ and @-@ weapons supplies . &quot;
dzhagaryan also expects record number of iranian tourists to draw to russia this year .
last year , russia &apos;s diplomatic representative in iran presented 35,000 visas to iranian citizens , most of whom were for travel .
in addition , iran was among the top 20 foreign tourists visiting russia for the first time .
we can say that a record of iranian tourists visiting russia last year will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , less russia is visiting iran with a relative sense of hope of changing the envoy .
&quot; i personally suggest the visit of the cities of isfahan , siraz and yezd where the monuments of ancient pers are well hidden . &quot;
shipments to fetc are in izmir for economic news
the fights that have been taken into custody for providing financial support to fetc have started uncovering interceptions with the group &apos;s board of directors chairman abdullah kavuk and the chairman of the kucukantic group &apos;s executive board , ahmet kucukançi .
fetull &apos;s financial resources , v1 and 2 , in izmir , have determined to send a simulated amount of money to fetullah gulen , the leader of the cfo / pdy terror group , on a regular basis each month .
money sent to gulen for the failure to pass through the records was found not to be invested in the banks , but was dispatched by a member of the organisation , kurd .
meanwhile , 9 people have been detained in amasya over the alleged fta coup attempt and arrested in court , including fatih altinay , who heads the chamber of commerce and industry , on trial . 7 people were released on condition of criminal control .
in 10 @-@ year term , 30,000 lira in the pocket
president recep tayyip erdogan &apos;s call , &quot; honestly , &quot; has moved on to the banks .
first , it was proposed that banks be included in the real estate house , which was then attended by gyoder .
the proposal to reduce housing mortgages to less than 1 per cent was also seen as psychological .
the 13 banks placed interest rates on housing loans at less than 1 per cent .
public banks have since launched the gospel .
previously , the latest arrangement -- given the monthly interest rates of between 1,12 per cent and 1.2 billion euros -- will pay less interest between consumer and 30 billion tl , which uses a 10 @-@ year mortgage .
the choice is 5 per cent
how much benefits will interest reductions be for domestic creditors ?
using a ten @-@ year loan with 100,000 lira , the one who has been using the loan will provide 30,000 lira benefits from a lowered interest rate .
the majority of housing loans are selected for the payment plan of 5 to 10 years .
interest rates are expected to drop further in the coming days .
interest reduction will also positively affect sales .
in 2015 , housing sales increased by 10.6 per cent year @-@ on @-@ year to 1,289,000 .
sales are expected to surpass 1.5m euros in interest this year .
gyoder president aziz torun : it must be downsized to less than 9 per cent annually
the move is an important step towards public banks &apos; higher interest .
they have heard from the president &apos;s call and lowered rates .
however , it must be below 9 per cent annually .
if this discount continues , we are planning to extend the monthly interest campaign to 0.70 months that we are launching .
kuzu group lamb : my campaign could last up to 3 months
the participation of banks in this historic campaign could bring an extension of the period of the campaign by at least three to 4 months , which we limited to one month .
however , the credit interest rates must be lower than 9 per cent year @-@ on @-@ year .
this is very happy to see that only the housing sector and the positive psychiatric and unprecedented solidarity in the real market , while citizens use the sacrifice of any business in buying housing .
polat holding ykb adnan polat : we expect full support from the banks
it is a good step for us to go to pay cuts after our call to the banks .
apart from that , there are some steps taken to stimulate the economy in all other sectors .
it is a campaign by ngos , the central bank &apos;s decision and all steps that have taken in that direction ...
all the banks must put their hand under the stone .
you , you and you will join them as well as this one , together with us , on the same path , let &apos;s dry economic together , let &apos;s dare in the same way .
sabanci nets 1.5 billion tl investment in 1.5 billion

kabasif &apos;s vapore takes 2 years

lower interest , household raise
my friend sent a message .
it &apos;s always the same .
interest is falling , and household prices are on the rise .
interest rates are up , and household prices are dropping .
&quot; this is the time the father got so , &quot; he said .
she describes the sentiments that come to her because she is related to individual loans .
contractors have entered a campaign of 0.70 interest rates and have increased prices on various housing projects , according to property housing .
i looked at because that is true .
the situation is flawed , there are no more cannabis ...
then , meanwhile , we got a seal of the acclaimed terrorist organisation that participated in a construction summit organised by our newspaper a week after the july 15th coup attempt on july 15th .
the boss of a large firm ...
&quot; in fact , you &apos;re going to have the opportunity to deal with the coup ? &quot; he asked , adding that he would not give up his name until after 10 per cent of the prices were announced .
after the coup d &apos;eternal campaign , construction and a major sales campaign , called property housing , have launched a major sales campaign with a .70 per cent interest and 120 @-@ month maturity .
i accept his hand , before the banks , the risk was placed under the stone .
&quot; but we are working with unity and an equaliser to avoid the speed of turkey .
the 1 @-@ month campaign prompted banks to draw interest .
nobody should give an opportunity to increase then .
add to the lyrics in the direction .

bdk call for bdk : take the complaint by those banks
the head of the banking regulation and supervision agency ( bddk ) , mehmet ali akben , explained president erdogan &apos;s warning of &quot; credit back &quot; to the banks .
&quot; if banks turn to an opportunity because of the market &apos;s conditions for revising credit , we certainly can &apos;t allow this if they are turning it with different motives , &quot; said akben .
&quot; we give us such complaints and information , &apos; we &apos;ll give names on a bank and a company basis &apos; and we &apos;re putting in question with the bdk complaint .
&quot; i &apos;m talking about interest , and when the loans are extended , then we will open a new period in front of both our country &apos;s investors and our banks , both , &quot; president recep tayyip erdogan warned in a statement issued by the banks .
whoever it &apos;s stopped siphoning for our country &apos;s credit at this time is to give them a pure into the loans , and i want to announce it .
interest rates were 7 per cent to 8 per cent annually , and banks took money from the job .
more than 500,000 russian tourists expected
ali kizildag , head of the association of professional hotel administrators ( poyd ) , says turkish @-@ russian relations are on a positive course ahead of the july 15th coup initiative in expo 2016 , while flights from russia to antalya have been launched , and a certain turnover in tourism .
&quot; i expect very positive developments in all sectors , both from tourism and agriculture , for example , from construction to construction , &quot; said yildirdag , who is also excited that president recep tayyip erdogan and russian president vladimir putin have met with trade @-@ offs .
turkey and russia have very close two countries , traditional relations based on years .
&quot; on this road by the leaders of the two countries , i think we can quickly close the distances and move towards the goals if we move very fast , &quot; he said .
he said he hoped the number of russian tourists arriving in turkey would exceed 1 million if it were not a coup attempt .
but we lost a month after we were hit by a high season , so the goal is minimised .
however , i think that if the charter takes the flight , we will surpass 500,000 .
then there is the reason for the season to be extended to the middle of october , even by the end of october .
in such a situation , additional flights may be available per year .
i predict that this positive tone will be very well regarded by the russian people as well .
they too have an disease for turkey .
i think that with this momentum we &apos;ll have to build up to 700,000 troops .
he said he is hopeful for 2017 as well as for the russian market , adding that the two countries &apos; relations and the number of russian tourists could grow by more than 3 million next year .
by lifting the ban on public staff , the domestic reservoirs began small , &quot; according to poyd chairman kizillah . &quot; there are recycling returns in image reservations , and new reservations have also started to be taken . &quot;
&quot; we have hope of eid @-@ ul @-@ adha , &quot; he said .
he also said that lifting a ban on selling tickets to iranian travel agencies after the coup d &apos;etat was also a very positive development . &quot; if we can bring 100,000 to 100,000 people a month from iran , it would be very good , &quot; he said .
defeat , an existing loan ?
first , they meet with the bank when you get a loan , learning how the new interest conditions are how to influence the credit .
pay for early closure , along with a lower interest of up to 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of the cost used for the loan , is calculated from the bank .
if you are included in all costs , you can still apply for a favourable , low @-@ interest loan use .
there is no breathing for aslan !

one of the biggest surprises in swimming history was the victory of yen dmitriy balandin .
in the 200m butterfly as the favourite of the us swimmers , balandin balandin scored a victory in 2 minutes , in 46 seconds .
josh prenot of the united states , who took the first ever swim in kazakhstan and took the gold in the event of a time of 2 : 07.53 , was followed by russia &apos;s chupkov , with a time of 2 : 07.70 .
sun : take the forefront of friendship
shenol gunes , the besiktas coach , said the superior cup will be very meaningful for camia because it coincided with the anniversary of sulejman seba &apos;s death .
&quot; i am convinced that friendship will be a precondition for friendship not only in the field but also in the stands , in the stands when we need more than ever more than the time we needed my brother , &quot; the veteran coach said .
fetric leader : his assets seized
the property , which is owned by individuals and organisations connected to the bureau for the investigation of terrorist @-@ technical and organised crime , was supposedly increased in the imposition of a fantastic change in the imaginary planning and so @-@ called etc / pdy terrorist group , then charged 17 suspected in the indictment against the main court .
in the trial against him for his alleged involvement in attempted disbanding the constitutional order of fetullah gulen , the 1 defendant , the court &apos;s delegation , decided to arrest the men omar ekinci , kemal elibal and cemal soncu , along with gulen .
but the court decided to conduct criminal proceedings for the four defendants , who had not been at large until now and had not arrived at the hearings .
the adana 2 heavy sentencing court ruled that all &quot; criminal procedure motives &quot; should include all 278 / identities in the country , omer ekinci , kemal elibal and cemal soncu , who are on the run in a foreign country to ensure the trial remains fruitless .
the court &apos;s decision froze deportations , land @-@ sea and air transport vehicles in turkey , all rights and rights of land , their company share of appliances , dirt tapes and bank accounts .
huseyin klilan &apos;s demolition , demolition demolition hinges on 33rd leg collapse
commenting on fetc &apos;s attempt for a coup , huseyin besieged words .
he was sold to the head by huseyin gunes :
&quot; they could be diagnosed , but they could not , in a chain of command , &quot; wrote the author of what he wrote in the summer of 5 to 6 months , as he wrote of what he described as a brutal coup against others .
i did not know two things ; first , he was pervasive and deep , the 8 @-@ year emir of the mesela gendarmerie , and the youths of mr. president .
the man who fought the most , choosing how to pay attention to it , but the most important characteristic of them is the privacy .
they are two centuries captive .
&quot; it &apos;s not that a pensioner like this fete can do what he can do , &quot; he said . &quot; one of the most important evidence is that it is such a deep casino .
cia receives support .
cia took it too soon .
mahmut praised him in 2014 , where he met with fuat east and fetullah at his house in 1971 .
at the time , he said , the most recent time was relations between mit and cia , the people interested in these jobs .
we have paid the salaries of personnel from the armed forces in the united states , and this is one man who did not remember them .
when we learn about it , we are doing it in 2014 .
after this summer &apos;s article , mahmut bey had no explanation for that .
for example , isn &apos;t he fair and isn &apos;t he caught at the base ?
he wonders .
he spent the last 25 days in pensilia , 2 days before the coup .
it has been about 109 times since fair @-@ free 2002 .
when you bring all this together , one must study the show -- all of them went to the united states starting in march 1999 when they went to the fetule , when they went to the united states .
the event will be seen that they went to the pensilia with a bearer .
but cia and its main contact can be detected from match @-@ fixing ; in particular , there have been a lot of people sent to the united states in security terms that have to be raised through the police .
wikileaks has documents ; it establishes an association and has held joint meetings with cia .
fifteen years ago , efforts were made to demonstrate that connections to cia were made .
fuat avni avni is a intelligence pool in the penitentiary , which i said was only 2 years ago .
adam avni , who works as prime minister , works for fuat avni .
but it &apos;s bad ; this information has fallen to cia , as it has fallen into penitentiary .
the demolition of gulen depends on the collapse of three shacks ; one was by the base , which is a friend &apos;s , but the ones who are in deep hipnothing -- even erdogan &apos;s film , say that the coup coup effort is still a movie .
i have been thrilling three leks , a base support .
the stolen questions , theft , the right to knowing it , proved to be that contributor to that base support .
the other two are political support , international support .
international support is still available .
the only thing that would compare political support is the certificate of the tapes taken by baykal and mhp executioners .
after july 15th , &quot; mr. kilic &quot; used his own use , opened everyone &apos;s eyes .
&quot; i &apos;m doing it me here , &quot; he said .
&quot; on my side , the jews in huseyin huy said , the girls are seeing so many thrilled dreams , i &apos;ve sent me , i ban now , because it &apos;s not the right thing to deceive dreams , &quot; she said .
there was one audiotape recorded , the person when she saw that voice registry , baros kocakurt : have seen the girlfriends double the soap , our cheese douts .

coup workers &apos; obedience tv transmissions not interrupted
private television , which took the key to avert a coup attempt on july 15th night , continued to spread due to a coherent resistance to coup plotters in turksat .
that &apos;s his hero heroic ackaya ...
according to akkaya , who had entered the transcript following the release of the declaration in trt , they had entered the vocal psychiatric . &quot; i got everything from the helicopter thinking that my friend were dead . &quot;
they asked for weapons to spread and cut publications .
i simply closed local tv stations .
then i then managed to get away from the building , saying we should go to the cans .
i spent as much time in the department where we had the anthrowers .
&quot; i &apos;ve also cut some cabins here but did not touch publications , &quot; he said .
the coup plotters rushed to remove the spread of turksat , which brought tv experts .
instead of the incident , they were arrested by police officers who came three minutes ago .
he said that about 1 hours after returning to the building , he realises that tv channels are still in place , and was neck @-@ down .
that evening i took over the reins at 8 pm .
the orchestra was us home .
i was a friend of the e @-@ state and electricity system .
we had to meet to drink as early as 2pm , flying troubles from our downhill .
the helicopter was also in the vicinity of the aircraft , which had muted silent gunfire .
we have seen their livelihood .
it was probably the most humane air vehicles to be found .
they flew through the streets of the helipks .
11 years later , i was coughing the nil because for the first time i saw so close flights .
then they started to take a ride .
we &apos;ve heard about reports that the bridge is closed .
our general manager ordered friends to come to the building for the building , which is not at the time .
we learned that all of the broadcasts in the tra have fallen in to obtain information .
train transmissions were cut for 5 minutes .
trt was hit by a main roof .
our control station said that trt publications have been restored and have begun to read out .
our deputy chief executive , halil greilcimen , asked that the trt be immediately cut off by the director &apos;s orders .
we have started working to cut the publication because trt has broadcast broadcasts across 3 stations .
just before we heard that &#91; prime minister binali yildirim &#93; had said &apos; thriller &apos; .
our principal &apos;s order , &apos; tra &apos; , placed us some resistance to psychiatric .
we cut the trend and heard some time later the helicopter .
we went out , then smashed in all places , with everyone dispersed .
on the other side , we are hiding in a building .
we had a total of 12 .
when we crossed it , soldiers landed by the helicopter entered the service .
we had a few friends .
we have also emerged so that it is not alone .
i saw that they caught our deputy director and had collapsed .
they were speaking amongst themselves .
&quot; let &apos;s hit one of us , it &apos;s a comedy . &quot;
and then they sit down all of us .
kim , who is also the commander of the camp , started shouting &quot; i can &apos;t even ask . &quot;
we also heard the kind of &apos; let &apos;s hit &apos; style speeches : we don &apos;t know what we &apos;ve done from home , but we have an instruction to us , it &apos;s final &apos; . &quot;
there is resistance .
i felt at that moment that i gave up my own life .
i said &apos; i say &apos; .
i &apos;ve come back to my feet before i knew what to do then .
what i thought at the time was that my helicopter was fired at my friends , nizam .
i thought there were 10 to 15 friends &apos; lives in nizam , and thought &apos; finally they would kill us , &apos; i &apos;m going to have crushed thrills . &apos; &quot;
all military services , except with the commander of major , were keseceqin &apos;s , chief of staff .
we have a system of synod when local channels adorned .
we are spreading from about 200 local channels to the office , promising 80 of them .
she was there .
there were no national broadcasts .
if i guarded them , and if all say they have been cut , i would have until then my support or the outside .
or i would say it would go anywhere .
we have acknowledged that , in the end , we will not be able to leave .
&apos; i &apos;m guaranteeing me &apos; .
i cut the memory of one of the local channel packages .
i guarded the power wedding to the monitors when we could monitor national channels .
thus , there would be no signal in all announcements .
i have said that i should not go to the things in order to be completely cut .
he and two soldiers drive for the antenna .
i opened the room for antenna , one of them was &apos; orchard &apos; , &quot; he said .
he was named my gun .
i will finally hit , somewhere by cutting down all of the trt except , without one , or at one , by one side , &quot; he said .
and i was told that , now , &quot; all of the time i had gotten in my life , i said , nothing more .
we entered the tender , brought together local publications .
we passed through other antenna .
then , there was a system in which we would get in hand to the tune of 20 national channels .
about 20 monitonists have entered the door as local channels kesink .
rabbim helped us so much that he didn &apos;t have a problem when he answered , or tied their pressure .
they believed in the answers we gave .
he didn &apos;t want .
it was a relief from us .
after they emerged from the antenna , they asked for the tram to be replaced .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how i have a tv set , &apos; i have no electricity . &apos; i asked you to have an electrician &apos; in your pursuit .
&quot; there &apos;s no electricity after night , if you can , the team said , &apos; come out &apos; .
in fact , he had electricity .
i did not give up the cyprus publications .
i was also thinking about cutting them to defuse them .
they were somewhat relieved because they thought the publications were being cut .
they were reluctant to look at the publications .
now the group is on hold .
about an hour later , they opened tv in the waiting room to see that aired the news .
the detachment is in the presence of soldiers .
my commander does not end the news , &quot; he said .
we were seen with the commander .
&apos; get out &apos; , &quot; he told setimes .
i was gone .
he said a soldier still had publications which are being carried out .
there are channels broadcasting in cyprus , &quot; he said .
&quot; they are broadcasting over cyprus , they could be told &apos; i could not do anything &apos; to them , &quot; he said .
&quot; then move us all together after dawn with each other , &quot; he said .
coup plotters flew into a miniature of turksat .
i got a lot of pictures from the army , which took me to the toilet , where he was summarily executed at that miniature .
they shot at 3 times , shooting themselves in their hand and hearts .
my friends confirmed that he was the same soldier .
they addressed that corps .
it was probably a soldier .
they could be executed to get rid of him .
asim akkaya said that turksat came from the first police team , shaqan .
police teams were also involved in helicopters , returning to the town , when they found to know that the safety agents were scanned , and bought the munitions .
they returned 40 minutes later .
when police teams took the lead , turksat saw no one in its external intent .
&quot; they called our police teams from us , turkishness personnel , we should say , &apos; we should enter into an emergency &apos; , &quot; he said , identifying that only 3 @-@ 4 minutes after a police expert sent from the tv station came to the building .
&quot; the police used only one phone call , four of them scuttled with an identity @-@ related problem , and reported &apos; we were caught &apos; , &apos; &quot; he said .

&quot; all this is public , &quot; she said , recalling that the organisation has also activities in the media and business community in macedonia .

the sky to be seen in meteor showers
dr. hasan esenoglu , a professor of national observatory in tubitak and a professor of astronomy at istanbul university , said in a statement to one of the aa contributors that perseid would reach the highest point , which connects the friday ( august 12th ) .
thousands of songs intended for the impact of sun lights and showering from the queuing star singing &quot; swiftly - swiftly , &quot; esenoglu explained , adding that it would turn into natural scourge .
the perseid bust was first discovered in 1862 , and since the 1990s it was repaired in the world , esenoglu said .
&quot; we need to watch such a visitor @-@ like game that comes from space in july and august , &quot; said esenoglu , expressing the spectre of the repercussion there during the past months .
consequently , this natural phenomenon has died .
&quot; the universe will contribute to us to better recognition , &quot; he said .
with standoff , the temperature will hit the light
esenoglu took a attention from the fact that some of the pieces charred during the glorious rain will fall to the size of the size of authority .
the reflection could range as many as 2,000 seconds .
due to heating and dependency in the atmosphere , persecutions produce low levels in the natural environment , while temperature is tempered with white flour .
one can contribute to science , writing from the website of the international organisation for rainbow .
this data is worth of information because it is gathered anywhere in the world .
all night to be watched
he reminded that the rain spilled about 60km at the polls , and said this spectre could have been monitored throughout the entire night , well from scarce areas in the direction of the east to the whole night .
more than 100 blasts occurred annually , esenoglu said , after the defensive rainy rainy it was between december 4th and 17th , it was worth a depreciative nature to watch the getaway .
former player erdogan educated , former footballer
this balance was overturned by the old populist slopes , led by longtime former footballer recep tayyip erdogan , who won over 1,000 schools , collections of the institute for universities and education top grades that formed more than 1,000 schools , universities and education in techniques .
an article from the above @-@ mentioned foundation , foreign policy , published last week .
turkish football superintendent erdogan , who has a university degree , is well @-@ educated and former footballer ; gunlen , who holds his secondary education , has described upholding as a widespread entrepreneur , and has often become involved in western media reports .
after that , &quot; why increase america and / or western opposition in turkey ? &quot; in the temple articles , erdogan tries to clarify what he started ...
antagonism in turkey can be seen as news of turkey &apos;s history , which has come to mind as a nevzuhur situation during erdogan &apos;s term .
in fact , given statistics , erdogan could be read during the first ten years as the period of action , at a time when western opposition in turkey fell or on average .
during those ten years , however , the united states and the united states have maintained good relations .
erdogan has criticised israel for his &quot; haircut , &quot; which has been met with the turkish leader of the now @-@ defunct pro @-@ kurdish government , the eu &apos;s top diplomat in syria , and the leader of the so @-@ called &quot; mastermind , &quot; who has been fighting against a clear policy in the country after the crackdown on the syrian regime ended .
as a bloody coup d &apos;etat has lost 247 people , let us lose no support until proof of the failure of the so @-@ called eu countries and the united states , as well as the united states , has let us forget about the fact that peace and stability are building in turkey , waiting for the establishment of peace and stability in its first official democracy and government .
but how will it be a month since many leaders from turkey -- including 11 charlie hebdo -- joined in paris to protest , because 11 charlie hebdo workers were killed , but how would you remember that turkey was not able to head any western country that had testified against democracy only a month after 247 people were killed in a coup that had been killed ?
what remains to be done to send lower levels of representatives of the heads or high @-@ level representatives who come a few times a year for the refugee issue ?
how can we assess the fact that all eu and us ambassadors went to the past , so that the mosque was broken down and that they did not have a solidarity visit to the bombardment of the turkish parliament ?
if the first two weeks of coup in egypt were when the eu launched a coup d &apos;etat with its top representative speeding leader , speeding up a coup d &apos;etat in the wake of kerry &apos;s coup at the end of the coup , &quot; if it remembers that turkey is concerned about the opportunities of turkey in both of turkey &apos;s western countries , which are no longer in support of democracy ?
even allowing 95 % of citizens to freely live freely in the united states , as those responsible for the coup , is currently keeping turks away .
if the backdrop i put forward , i think that the rising western / american opposition is obviously not to be explained only to erdogan .
&quot; moreover , erdogan has not even said that he thought there is an impact on the coup that is in the face of the united states ...
that to happen , isolation was aggravated
humans , who perceive their own people as small and &quot; polling stations , &quot; saddled with unthinkable voters like him , shouting &quot; hearings &quot; that are out of the dark , and after 15 july , can they steal it from the same wise ?
after seeing how this people had a state and democracy , what was the question of &quot; where we were wrong &quot; ?
but is it so the question to be found ?
at various levels until the end of the world , hain was given the right to use the state &apos;s weapons , as well as officers , who were right to enter into state arms , and asked for refuge from foreign states .
we need to see how we live in a fractious atmosphere of mentality , and what kind of tactics that have taken the people into behavior they call people devil .
when it comes to the spectacular defamation attempt ...
was there any talk of requesting these actions along the lines of turkey &apos;s cities in syria ?
why why would one officer shell his own country &apos;s parliament ?
we should not have come down from declarations with mini @-@ declarations , such as waiting for appropriate behavior .
other policymakers , but let &apos;s be responsible for everything .
the paths that present politics as a fighter of confrontations , kin and hate have done their necessary contribution to the tragedies .
they also presented themselves as &quot; intellectual &quot; and believed that every form of non @-@ rule was of law and even demographics were natural .
we have finally seen how they opened fire on this public when hate were fired at the hands of their own people .
how we know democracy is the way we know
&quot; i say very simple . on the evening of july 15th , turkey &apos;s military ship from the people to the pseed shirkers , they killed 250 people and founded democracy , and built it only to save democracy .
but there are three deadlines behind july 15th 1992 @-@ 2002 , 2002 @-@ 2012 ; 2012 ; and beyond .
there are three changes set in this period : economic , social , political .
social change compiled two large phenomena : metropolitan migration of rural areas and moving to the centre after being kept in the surrounding cities for a very long time .
on wednesday , i specified that this transfer was through the metro .
i have also emphasised that it is the most important social factor for a metro or not .
the second big change in the same direction was bridges and roads .
it is increasingly understood that the road and bridge contribute to modernisation .
the road is economic and social structure changing .
in us , too , he has changed his political structure .
i have been able to identify bridges that have orchestrated this landmark in istanbul .
demirel is the site of the bosphorus bridge .
this was the case in the 1950s of the peasants &apos; movement in the 1950s .
ozal remained the second bridge in which we changed his name to the 15 july martyrs bridge , in the same eastern part .
even along the route , they demonstrate the relationship between the surrounding -- and central .
that is a sign of how to follow a course of social change .
the machine of demirel and ozal was at the centre for big crowds .
the centre was meant to send an enthusiasm to them .
the ec party has not built its third bridge over the years .
because migration was going on at all pace .
people were placed in satellite cities .
a somewhat closed system was established in that area .
local administrations in the ec party voted for people as annulled , employs , social status , and then the coe party .
the mass was not applicable in the centre , but it was asked to gain political awareness in the environment and to &apos; themselves &apos; after all .
the formation was in opposition to the ongoing debate among women in turkey in the run @-@ up to the ak party ( 1992 @-@ 2002 ) .
these debates have drawn fire from modernists , tears and followers , who have not been integrated into the centre , but rather from locals who stood by side @-@ by @-@ side .
the ec party acted in a method that i said after 2002 , politicising the masses , asserting politics , maturity and maturity .
after that , the score is now the wife of the democratic struggle on 15 july with the construction of the 3rd bridge .
it means history and sociology .
i could add another dimension to this : the akp &apos;s move , which i mentioned , is not just limited to istanbul bridges .
it &apos;s more interesting : the akp is now bringing the surrounding cities into the centre .
this is being provided via two bridges .
one , the osmani bridge .
two , canakkale 1915 .
add that .
turkey will now reach another route from thrace to izmir .
you know what to say , izmir will now be a bamoth town after that .
let &apos;s take it from outside izmir , where he cannot obtain membership from the ak party .
now bursa , canakkale , now thrace cities will be transformed into other craftsmen and social geography .
it &apos;s enough !
15 july martyrs are the stars of this great adventure .
van persie and neshrine idman in fenerbahce
fenerbahce continued to teach in the morning when he took part in preparations for the grand shoppers game .
coaches began at the can bartu facility at 10pm , in the management of coach vitor pereira . a total of 1 hours lasted 30 minutes .
the players , who took to the field after 30 minutes of corn training , were coupled with speakers , sprinkled by speedophers and heating , as well as the tie @-@ and @-@ piping events at the hall .
she was coached by painting matches in the narrow field .
fenerbahce will continue its preparations in the day of the day with an training .
he &apos;s the person to complain to st yildirim ...
new developments on the match @-@ fixing operation against fenerbahce have come to light .
huseyin ildirim , a journalist who participated in a programme run by cnn turk and announced that this operation was carried out by the fetc , &quot; has raised the words of saint yıllah ildirim , a sports figure , who is also a sports figure . &quot;
&quot; daunting , one day on the plane , there is what happened next to senin fethullah gulen . &quot;
he tells setimes of his words by fethularian saint yildirim .
why did he wore st yildirim ?
the head of turkey &apos;s largest adversary , the club , thinks he can harm him .
the &quot; schooling case was to liquidate st yildirim , &quot; as he put it .
a statement following those remarks came from faik isik , a key lawyer in the match for the match for match @-@ fixing .
ayik news appeared on the opposite position in turkey and revealed the compulsory person who complained to fetc leader fethullah gulen .
that &apos;s what faik faik promises :
saint yildirim says he is doing something to ihsan kalkavan about fethullah .
he travels from azerbaijan , while on a private plane .
st bey is a flavour man , where he also criticises his criticisms .
that sentiment is perhaps a little poultry .
some of them can react .
these images are being raised one place .
the carols , himmetler , are so sophisticated to their favor of the hac , like the one who went to the umre .
they say they are neither a job ; they are highly critical .
this is not the only question , of course .
meanwhile , a football team is testing it .
it is the direct connection and the right thing of some football players and managers from the galatasaray club ...
muharrem veteran : to the mothermometer
trabzonsport head muharrem ucote extended his hand of friendship to fenerbahce .
&quot; we are on the side of this country with 79 million . &quot;
we have to show a devil .
if fenerbahce has a problem with fenerbahce , i am without justice , and i am for fenerbahce .
&quot; but the match between trabzonsport and fenerbahce is different , &quot; he said .
victim prices released
&quot; we as a union established kilogram the price of kilogram of the vibrant victim , 18 lira , &quot; he said .
&quot; we also identified the price of cannabis as 15 lira , the same thing that we &apos;ve taught as 17 lira , the second class , &quot; he said .
noting that animals that were not victims of last year were also put on sale , karabulut said the citizens had to pay attention to their sacrifice .
in particular , it has to pay attention to eavesdropping .
it is also very important that the animal is healthy .
they can then control our citizens &apos; love while sacrificing the animal &apos;s passport .
in terms of its foreign outlook , it must also be a life and resilience of the victim .
and on the surface , one should not have signs like a smile .
in the past years , we have seen that animals that were not victims are being put up for sale and sold .
the animal , a victim , has to refill its age .
we can see this by taking care of the animals .
the fuss that a animal filled the age of 2 had been found as the cover &apos; .
but they didn &apos;t show up .
animal may be entertained as a photograph , but tranquil may be invisible .
and if the tigers are already too small for others , they are quickly noticed .
rize airport to be put to the sea
the second airport to be built in turkey with sea full will be built by rize airport .
the rize airport will be built on a seaside site dating back to 266 hectares of land between the market town of yesililkoy and the girl tower post , 26m to 32m from the coast .
the rize airport will be used for about 3 times more filtering material than that used at the yesun airport , because the construction is too deep .
under the project , 36 planes will be built in the 45m @-@ long , 3,0000m @-@ long pist and apron , which is supposed to run in the morning .

fertiliser for 8 consume prices
fuel @-@ distributors increased the average rate of fertiliser to his litre , compared to midnight .
the average price of the engine will increase by 8 cents as of august 13th 2016 , according to information from the union of oil products ( body ) .
under that , the price of a bike from ankara -- which is 3.68 lira on average -- will rise to 3.76 lira .
its cost will be 3.71 lira lira of istanbul , up from an average of 3.63 lira , and 3.74 lira on average in izmir .
the prices set out by distribution companies can show a small change compared to companies and cities , due to competition and liberalisation .
fuel distributors increased 4 regulations last week on the litre of his engine .

the phrase about robert amsterdam &apos;s fhere !
robert amsterdam , an official of the us @-@ based company forbes , which investigating international law in the fetullak terrorist group &apos;s ( fetule ) illegal activities , provided an article to the us magazine forbes , sharing information on how the fetule was organised .
nonetheless , fetullah gunel is managing his organisation at fault , according to amsterdam , which means &quot; the school of some 150 contract ( charter ) in the united states is quite clear how it works , the organisation &apos;s ability to gain hidden secret @-@ developed organization . &quot;
seven months ago , amsterdam reported that companies associated with turkey had been mandated to investigate them and schools , stressing that what they found so far were &quot; shocking . &quot;
amsterdam included in the article :
the whirling man told us that his organisation has a strict hierarchy where instructions have been issued .
the directives were usually reported at face @-@ to @-@ face meetings in poconos .
the management group of seven people ( consulit ) in the top .
they elaborate on the advisory committee .
the instructions are then headed to the regional imams , their country imams , productions , productions of towns in the country , organisms , manuscripts of their preserves , the image of students ( their homes ) and the students , respectively , and students to go to the homes of their homes .
businessmen , bureaucrats and officers are at different levels , depending on their positions and support from the organisation .
according to amsterdam , the organisation has opened 55,000 jobs worldwide , making it the largest network of contract submissions in the united states , and says millions of dollars were granted to these schools every year from taxes paid by american taxpayers .
most of these money , amsterdam said , was lodged by organisation members and channeled into &quot; elected &quot; subcontractors .
amsterdam says it is the same as in one case :
magnia school , a board in california , was arrested in the company , which is connected to the same office , providing $ 700,000 for annual services .
amsterdam cited the dove science academy in oklahoma as another example .
amsterdam noted that this school also paid $ 3.1m to the owners of property , as well as determined that it is made up of the school and the same people with links to the company &apos;s management .
according to amsterdam , the largest position in the network , there are similar situations in the 46 branch schools . he said more payroll companies are being paid for , including software licenses for smaller companies with links to smaller companies , curricula .
amsterdam underlined that it was rich in one fta . &quot; my example indicates that about $ 28m in misuse of american taxpayers is misused , &quot; amsterdam said , stressing that she had become a rich member of the nmd .
&quot; and this is a visible part of our clouds so far , &quot; he said .
noting that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents , amsterdam reminded that in his language , the situation had worsened even more , with all of them began to investigate the irregularities of the techniques of the technique education agency .
amsterdam stressed that schools operate normally , there are no information on how many employees are corrupt .
&quot; however , in fact , these schools are such as a snowadays , for the purpose of dealing with the school , &quot; amsterdam said .
&quot; the money that was then loaded on huge amounts is used for political donations to hide their lawless activities . &quot;
according to amsterdam , a former american teacher who worked for these schools , there were separate meetings among some workers in guarantors , and &quot; some of the members of the turkish armed forces are believed to be working on a similar course . &quot;
the coup protestors used to reinforce their positions within the years .
&quot; however , it looked like the army was normally doing business , thereby giving power behind a parallel force , &quot; he wrote .
amsterdam finished its article :
there are questions about the july 15th @-@ 16th events at the head of policy busts in the united states , which are expected .
however , when the two allies are taken on a diplomatic level , it is necessary that those in the state authorities themselves falsely violate the us laws in their operations .

the value of all assets of its hakan and her father , selmet susur , is estimated at around 200m lira .
fugitive police chief arrested in zaho
the 3rd @-@ class police director in batman &apos;s police department , ahmet duran , was named as part of an investigation into the fetc &apos;s coup attempt .
a decision on his arrest was made following the arrest .
the work , conducted by the department of municipal security , determined that it had escaped zaho , iraq .
he was arrested in a joint operation by the security forces of the two countries .
he was detained in batman as soon as he was brought to turkey .
as soon as possible , he was transferred to the courthouse following the police action .
security forces stand on a suspicion that they fled to northern iraq to join pkk camps .
children pay attention to this habit
serbian designer dr. bilgin giray said the children are relieved with this reflection , becoming a need for restraint because they could not carry out the initial adjudication of the teeth .
listing the reasons for fingerprint custom habits in the children , dr giray said , &quot; the police are a phenomenon that can be seen from three to 4 upon birth . &quot;
most babies are emer .
to satisfy the need for embezzlement , she said she would have her money to satisfy and enjoy her mother @-@ in @-@ law through the age of 1 to 1.5 .
&quot; it can be embedded and act of fingerprinting when it comes to self @-@ lies , when it comes to obedience and remorse , when it is genuinely and leave , it can act of monetary behaviour , &quot; he said .
stressing that she understands her incompetence in the fundamentals of embedded embedded embezzlement and lack of trust in children , doc dr. bilgin giy explains the dental health consequences .
being a parmatim would have a negative impact on how the child &apos;s dentist is shaped .
in the wake of pressure on the emme escort , successors may be pushed forward , while six of them have reply reply as a substitute .
this would cause the sub @-@ wreaths to be placed behind the substance , thereby disturbing the balance of the damal and dental structure .
the physiological reflection of this , however , would seem to be a fantastic view of the deterioration and closure .
&quot; we can preserve our children from development and preoccupations without being finished , &quot; he said , noting that permanent tusks could be faced with much more complicated treatment during the age of 6 @-@ 7 if there is no premature solution .
&quot; this is why the mouth of children today , like monitoring and restraint control of the children , needs to be kept under control , &quot; he said .
incoming monitoring : new breaths : the stands
after katarakt treatment , patients do not wish to exercise restraint naturally .
the margins , which have long been in our patients to address this problem , are already in use since long periods .
the introductory tribute of the treatment , which was recently introduced , made another step forward .
the margin of triggers from other currencies is not only distant or close distance , but also a clear view of the occasionally defined distance .
inherited , close or occurrence from clouds
the interrupted distance represents a main point in our daily life .
as an example , we are in the distance between the currents of cars , which are logical and intermediary computers in our pupils , or at 60 @-@ 70cm per barrels .
they also recover from the tricals , which do not need some kind of monitoring of our patients in any way , because they need them to make a close or remote difference .
another advantage that trimmed tribute to trifokal demons is to reduce their meaningful complaints .
&quot; there is no difference from the regular treatment of trifokal lens treatment of every distance , &quot; said professor of eye disease dr volkan hurmeric .
our patients , who are performing trifockal treatment , will receive comfort comfortably with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes .
and the next day our patients can return to their normal life .
it is an effort to improve the quality of life for people who use cars in particular , have plenty of computers , want to read and live more actively .
you also resort to an eye @-@ in @-@ law expert to know if this procedure , which can be applied to every patient who has filled 18 years , is appropriate for you .
damar , a barmar from varisha , was not used in heart surgery !
in recent years , varis has been prone to a severe disruption in the situation .
genetic convergence is a priority factor ; long work hours , work scuttled to stay afloat and beef up for a long time .
will the davs be used in heart surgery ?
there is a name , a heart attack in the past , and the questions like what &apos;s often curtailed by people .
that &apos;s when they answer .
there are two types of artillery system in the bag :
there is a deep artillery system in which as many as 1,backers bear the main roadblocks to lung poles , where the main source of the bacam is getting a substitute .
they can take the name of deep photography and surface funny .
problems with these artillery are more rare , unclosed , and medicine treatments can be applied in order to remain open .
there are a surface artillery system in which the pregnant branch takes them to the lungs and crosses deep arithic artillery system .
this system consisted of cannabis , which we have two large and two small stages .
these gaps can also be incompetent and evolving in four places .
artillery artillery , which can be used in heart surgeries , are the surface @-@ to @-@ surface artillery surrounded by large survivors .
the lack of such daughters has no damage , and could thus be used for heart surgeries .
however , they need to be healthy because they can be used in heart surgery .
because heart is a very important body .
the presence of a varied grocery groom that was placed in place with surgery or in place , and deep artillery shells decreases reduce the workload and will make the baby more healthy .
a false belief among the general public is that the groceries can be used as a reserve , even though there is a ghetto .
damar , from varisha , never was used for heart surgery and never for heart surgery .
there are other vacations that could be used in heart surgeries .
the reserve system , which can be used for heart surgery , is located in the vicinity and around the mixture , under the umbrella cushion .
thus , it is precisely to put a pregnant baby on a heart and worry .

my message from ozbek to supercup is meaningful
dursun ozbek , president of the galatasaray sports club , issued a statement ahead of the super cup competition between galatasaray and besiktas .
dursun ozbek took the lead in turkish football to the unity and draw .
two long @-@ time , two @-@ observatory clubs in turkish sports , galatasaray and besiktas , will face the super cup in the konya metropolitan arena on saturday ( august 13th ) evening .
this match was neither the first ever , nor the final game in the competition , which left our biennale behind the one .
but it &apos;s a vital challenge .
as we all know , our country breached a great father on the night of july 15th , night .
the coup attempt by the fetullah terrorist group / parallel state ( fta / pdy ) that thrilled all segments of society due to the unity and equestrian unity of their society .
we paid heavy payments as a nation that night .
we are the martyrs .
we have a lot of veterans .
this painful remedy reminded us of the importance of democracy again , the necessity and importance of the disintegration of the peace , not the conflict in these lands .
representatives of turkish sports that night also met a single voice , a one against the coup , all along with democracy .
in these critical days , we need more than ever to combine sports .
i wish that this match , which takes place right back to the 2nd anniversary of our valuable rarity head sulejman seba and the club &apos;s new football season , named efsane turgay , will be a favourite love for turkish sports and peace .
i wish it to be my country and turkish sports to win , regardless of the sport at the end of the game in front of the stands in which galatasaray and besiktas fans will co @-@ operate in front of the half @-@ staff .

scot callum skinner flourishes in the house
the great britania team retained the title the three great britain &apos;s team won from 2012 , while callum skinner of skinner from skina won the men &apos;s race in the rio race .
glasgowi , 23 , served as a leading chorus by scotr chris hoy of scotland , and proudly returned to his home with her new zealand clothes , which was honoured .
britain was shocked by the event , which took five years ago , when he took the gold in six olympic religions .
and he was a retired man but repeated that , in march , he finished sixth in the world championship in london .
the problem between beijing and london was that of original jamie staff , a specialist , was replaced .
they did so at a time when they could prove exactly enthusiasm .
hoy &apos;s retirement also set up a vacuum as kian emadi and matt crampton tried to fill .
he had previously seen his potentials achieved and had not given up his british coach skinner .
four years ago , he and his champion , hindes , set a new zealand in the first round , although the country broke the olympic record in the race &apos;s round of expedition , along with hoy .
and the three -- from britain -- came to the couple for the gold .
although it was a little bit behind in their own round , she brought the kenny team to it , and skinner was based .
much of the transformation that allows hindes to use a larger tool to slow itself down , allowing it to maintain a tempo of kenny and , in particular , skinner &apos;s tempo .
he was followed by his home as a bbc expert , and sank over the podium by skinner , kenny and hins .
&quot; this is an honour comparison , &quot; said glasgowlu , 23 .
i am here just to give my best and announce the step .
in the final , we broke the olympic record and beat world champions .
it was really unbelievable .
this is not a better way to win .
he admitted being out of the runner @-@ up following a poor start in 2012 , when london won a victory with kenny and hoy .
that was followed by a response , and there was no way to submitting a demand from britain &apos;s opponents .
this time around , there was no such problem for an incredible victory .
&quot; we were like in london with all great british flags on the table , &quot; he said .
we are a calendar just three months ago .
that &apos;s why we lost a lot of world races , and it is really incredible to have won the olympics .
it &apos;s only an event for a nation , which won seven of the 10 competitions in both beijing and london , and a medal .
the measure we have shown during the last five months is for us to finish in the race track and field .
his stance is that hoy &apos;s dream of winning three gold records for a single olympics is not very impossible .
this , in turn , will mean six gold medals and a silver medal in canny , a british past gymnasium @-@ sports meclis , who was born on march 23rd and was also born -- steve redgrave redgrave redgrave , mo farah and roger bannor -- when he was born .
that is the same level as hoy .
kenny will now compete in the sprint race ; the race will begin today and will last three days .
&quot; for the time being , i can only enjoy it .
the team event has had some of the best events .
you can win together with your friends .
frankly , people live alone because they live on their own .
&quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be awarded the knight title , &quot; he said .
although this is only the event of this time around , there are many good news for the uk .
tsu bradley wiggins , ed cy cy , steven burke and owain doull were the winner in the four @-@ kilometre race .
he finished with 3 : 51.943 .
the world record 3 : 51.659 won the gold medal in 2012 .
the first round and final ( 22 : 42 ) will be determined in the second section of today , and will certainly draw more attention to wiggins .
in the run @-@ up to the feat , officials had come at a standoff with him while urging him to weigh his pair .
the event of the women , which will continue and be completed , has a world record set by laura trott , joanna rowsell shve , elinor barker and milngavie , by katie archie archibald , who is serving at 4 : 260 .
the great british team is counting on the powerful bicycle team to take the reins in the medium term of the olympic games and to win several medals .
expectations in rio have been lowered sharply , following great precision in beijing and london .
the background has seen dire development , which include the resignation of coach shane sutton in april due to the severity and difficult accusations , and the retirement of key figures such as hoy and victoria pendleton .
it is the first night since the competition on the runway , however , and the reputation of great britain for finishing an excellent time will now be proven again .
suspecting energy deal , future portland izabe
the future of the portland aluminium izabe ocam in victoria and the job of hundreds of workers in the company of energy supplying all supply contracts at testoria are in limbo .
the move follows a decision earlier this year by the government in victoria that the subsidies should not be overcome to continue the work of the facility .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old flat subsidy is in place in november .
alcoa &apos;s portland could be at risk , until 2000 .
the process of closure could lead to the fact that up to 2,000 jobs are directly or indirectly at risk .
and further chain effects could be established , as the whole of victoria congested about 10 per cent of its electricity .
in 2014 , alcoa point henry izabe closed her office , which led to the closure of the anglesea power plant last year .
alcoa &apos;s portland izabe is losing money and now faces the risk of closure .
the developments emerged after years of speculation based on the strengthening of the australian dollar and the recent inspection of the facility &apos;s consumer pay .
agl , who is at the loy yang power plant in the latrobe valley where he will shoot the great aluminum , has said he expects the other three owners to move to terminate their contracts .
the vast majority of the facility belongs to the joint venture of alcoa and alumina , and china &apos;s citic has smaller stakes in china and thorny companies in japan .
&quot; agl expects the portland facility to continue the work , which means that the izabe room will continue to seek physical power , &quot; he said .
the contracts , the agl said , were &quot; agreements on the risk balance &quot; that it must take effect in november 2016 .
they will be completed in 2017 because of a 12 @-@ month feathers period .
&quot; for this reason , agl said , the contracts will continue to contribute in 2017 fiscal year , &quot; the energy company said .
the impact agl may be exposed to in 2018 financial year and after potential gains , which is limited to the adoption of a strong @-@ term contract for wholesale electricity prices .
agl said the value of the contracts in his accounts has already dropped by as much as $ 187m because it is &quot; pending . &quot;
the decision on terminating the contracts &quot; does not affect alcoa &apos;s ability to provide electricity to the business or land in the field , &quot; alcoa said .
the us company signed a 20 @-@ year contract in 2010 , which was supposed to be enacted in november this year , but has so far refused to explain whether it was contracted .
analysts are skeptical about the possibility of closure both due to the economic difficulties of the portland izabe in victoria and the tomago facility near newswire .
responding to analysts earlier this week , agl &apos;s operations officer , stephen mikkels , said that portland uses nearly 600 megawatts of energy annually , and tomago &apos;s nearly 900 @-@ megawatt energy .
should both of these facilities be withdrawn from the market , the demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market would lead to a significant reduction .
and as a producer , this would not be a good development for us , &quot; he said .
not only the star of the cardashian tv programme but the star of self @-@ proclaimed tv show ; it is the backbone of vogue in september .
the fourth daughter of the kardashian @-@ jenner group , the model and administrator , anne kris , is at the door of his group &apos;s four anticipated september number .
he , a estee lauder marka ambassador , who was a pair of boy this week in the days of milan , paris and new york fashion , announced the news from his instram account on thursday .
&quot; when i looked at this door in a room full of people i loved , i felt sorry , &quot; he wrote .
after the door was unveiled , the whole cardashian @-@ jenner family ( in barda ) was once again prepared by the garnerstone and dzafov world , which provided problems in the bar , and everyone &apos;s most loves , and a family blind video , featuring the producer ryan seacrest ( either , or only a sword of the smiles , and a tributter party was preparing a last script .
although these almost all of the children &apos;s tv shows carry the &quot; birth day &quot; line up to the air @-@ to @-@ knamese ( seacressed at 8am ) , &quot; don &apos;t forget our sentiment ? &quot; and i remember that some other girls didn &apos;t know how to know our other daughters .
certainly , we are entering this period of september and a new cardboard .
kim , his hand , may have come out in front of the vogur , which may have come out in front of the vogur , ( the door had been shared with his wife , kanyway west , in april 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s september day has been a success .
vogue &apos;s september number one sold out in the year .
it commemorated one fashion magazine and its book of hero and a number of publications ( fashionable , fashionista found the content of publications in 615 of last year &apos;s 832 @-@ page volume .
it is also a closely watched process for opening the kapitan star ; pictures of the magazine have been leaked in the past two years ahead of the official announcement .
the women previously covered in the container are naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in recent years , the door has been given to celebrities that &quot; make a model &quot; rather than &quot; famous models . &quot;
oscar @-@ winning dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was at the door in 2013 , while the next year was told to lady gaga .
however , even when she describes her generation as the &quot; fledgling model , &quot; she can be said to be very good .
these celebrities are not young people , but they are all about the youth of today ( the rest of them ) , which can bring in relatives or reality by name in search of reality .
all of them are women who promote their skills in the entertainment field .
beyonce , located at the door of last year , spent some of his best moments in lemonade &apos;s arrival .
not everyone is happy with the success of jenner .
because of the reality , the position of jenner in the fashion world will always be disturbing .
in june , members of the original victoria model stephanie sejmour , jenner and her colleague , gigi hadid , applauded them , calling them the &quot; crazzy of the time . &quot;
once there have been reports of whether jenner would be able to get up to vogur , the idea has come to light again .
concentration of dissatisfaction , however , seems to be confused .
it is the backpack of vogur jenner &apos;s september number .
he is exactly a supermodel .
he heads to the books of marc jacobs .
estee lauder lays you out the fund .
he , together with his sisters , sold his own pictures in payroll @-@ payroll applications for you .
his photography sells pictures of her daughter in cindy crawford .
and in empty times , only his brother kourtney and his sons were also included on the tv set up to see their reality .
social legal support centres return 160,000 people each year
the industry is preparing for the impact of more funding cuts in hard @-@ to @-@ do operations , as more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable part of the nation have been turned down from social legal support centres .
three out of five in queensland are refused -- mostly the elderly , migrants , immigrants , protected workers , those who have no resources to fight victims and unfair evictions -- to offer free legal advice and representation .
social support services , which have depleted opportunities , are preparing for further cuts .
starting in june of next year , these legal support centres are scheduled to lose another 30 per cent of the federal financing .
social legal support centres director queensland director james farrel says that the national union &apos;s final report of the national union &apos;s legal support centre detects thousands of people who are registered to be rejected every year .
mr. farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government decision is not reversed .
&quot; queenas &apos; social legal support centers receive chronically insufficient financial support , which means that thousands of people could not access vital services that are needed , &quot; he said .
people who fight against violence , against power and brutal forces that have roots in governance , are facing problems that are all related to legal dimensions that are free and off ... all those workers who are careless for reparations and who , according to this report , face help from the need .
the federal government , which will cut funding by 30 per cent starting in june 2017 , is forcing thousands of queenciers to deal with the more complicated legal problems of the thousands of queensland residents .
we call on justice minister and queensland senator george brandis to regain those financing immediately so that people face a legal challenge .
last year , the government met its commitment to raising legal support to the national average .
now we need to look at the social legal support centres and the investments that the palaszcuk government will work on this key task .
donald trump campaign team sued after personnel allegedly fired weapons
new york : donald trump &apos;s campaign team has been sued for the fact that the director of north carolina operations did not take any action after he was told he had fired a staff of weapons while on a trip to cip in february .
the case was revealed wednesday in the case at the county court by the former software trainer vincent bordini of the provincial campaign team .
he said he expects to see a situation on the ground for months , but later realised this will not happen .
as he complained about bordini , the director cited earl philip as &quot; explanation of an arms , inspected the right @-@ wing signal , and carried nail in the vincent gate of vincent . &quot;
according to the complaint , the bordini local and regional campaign team filed a complaint with its leaders , after having found at least four more people with phillip and had the same experience .
&quot; there is no need for an fire to damage the weapons , &quot; he said in his complaint .
the trial was brought to the crowd in northern carolina two days after the proponent of the republican candidate for president , who said that his rival for the post of &quot; second constitutional amendment &quot; ( in the arms owners and weapons supporters ) could take action if she decides to elect a rival hillary clinton and elect their judges .
trump &apos;s campaign team said it was evaluating media on the basis of these promises and that it does not support the violence .
he is seeking compensation from the campaign team and from phillip for its obsolete damage , due to behavior and observance .
trump &apos;s spokesman , hope hicks , did not return swiftly to the distance that requested his comment .
efforts to reach phillip proved fruitless .
wcb , a local news investigator in charlotte , recently declared that phillip left the campaign .
his call for its consultancy , innovative consultants innovative services , was not quickly reversed .
rep. president @-@ designate donald trump is conducting a campaign that creates conflict .

one should report to the prosecutors &apos; offices .
it is a patriotic borrower .
&quot; everyone can be familiar with intelligence , there is no information about the safety of the police , or it &apos;s up to the men to look after , &quot; he said .
the information has been launched , as part of efforts , by the interior ministry , the general directorate of police and the national intelligence agency ( mit ) .
by contrast , those who serve the fetc for the citizens will be able to pass through the organisation &apos;s activities , such a practice that would allow for safety and police .
at www.egm.gov.tr / pages , information will be reserved for all those who conduct mla information that will be dispatched via their lignite links , www.mit.gov.tr , / setimes .
those who want the information presented by the police general department can added to the document .

control of property fund to be debated
turkey &apos;s asset fund , which is expected to be among the world &apos;s largest funds , was taken off a quiet quota law after appeals .
a re @-@ iteration of the fund for lack of a monitoring mechanism has been decided , but has been negotiated again without any change .
evaluating the akp @-@ funded turkish property fund canun sozcu.com. , chp mp and member of the budget commission utku cakivoye , evaluated the &quot; state property , pensioners &apos; pension cuts , employees &apos; will certainly be free of charge and we are resorted to this structure , which will be comprised of constitutional control mechanisms for the unemployed , &quot; he said .
the turkish property fund canun , which the government drafted to provide long @-@ term funds for investments and projects , was removed from the barba law tuesday , when it said the opposition needed to further discuss it .
now , however , the akp has changed its offer to the plan and the budget commission .
smm plan and budgetary commission member eskisehir cakić explains chp mp utku cakirozer to sozcu.com.
&quot; when it comes to the plan for this fund and the draft law to the budget commission , our former finance minister , zekeriya temizel , head of the chp delegation , has expressed our concern and concern , proposing that it be discussed in addition to tormenting it from the law , &quot; cakira said .
the government accepted this view and withdrew the bill .
the bill came to the commission in the same state .
&quot; the government is insisting that it be removed from the parliament in a week , &quot; he said .
&quot; we are the biggest concern in this law , &quot; cakirozer says , adding that there must be a consensus regarding the creation of an asset fund law .
&quot; assets which are state @-@ owned entities , pensioners , pensioners &apos; pension cuts , the unemployment fund for the unemployed , the proceeds from privatisation are transferred to a procedural one which does not have any responsibility , except the assembly and the counting of any responsibility , &quot; he said .
he added that the funding was provided by russia , china and the gulf countries &apos; oil revenues and trade , while the fund is funding that way . &quot; we have a savings deficit , &quot; he added .
that is why the fund will be comprised of public funds .
a total of 100 billion euros from the employment fund are planned to be transferred from the individual pension fund , which has to employ workers , and 50 billion euros from privatisation .
&quot; that is why this fund , which will be entirely embedded with the public money , has to be under the control of the state and that money should not be irresponsible , &quot; he said .
he emphasised that it is unacceptable for the fund to be kept out of the parliamentary control of a fund where state resources are collecting guarantees for the state &apos;s debt , and explained its concerns and concerns regarding the offer of the establishment fund .
the collection of such a large public asset , spending , work and transactions related to borrowing on the part of the public cannot only overrun the control of independent control companies .
it is necessary to also include public control and a transparent structure .
proposed by the law , there are no provisions regarding the control and transparency of the assets fund by constitutional institutions .
no constraints were imposed on how much resources would be transferred .
no one can question how this fund was used .
it cited major projects as the aim of its purpose .
this means not an unmonitored fund , except for the budget .
why isn &apos;t you in the budget ?
&quot; why are &#91; it &#93; a mockery or a parliamentary control ? &quot;
he said that while he is one of the mandated funds in the fund , they are not opposed to the channelling of the money , but it is done with incorrect , calculated mechanisms . &quot; there is a need for such a fund . &quot;
but if the government insists that this is the insistence , then we have to ensure that international standards apply in turkey , as well as in other countries where such investment funds are established .
it should be structured in a way that the mechanism for control and accountability must be established .
there must be no traces on which citizens can account until the end of their own money used to citizens .
&quot; we are pleased that the akp , in particular , is rebuffing our criticism in the parliament after the &#91; 15 july &#93; coup d &apos;etat , &quot; cakirozer stressed , stressing his staunchly opposed to the proposal .
we hope that in this proposal we will listen to our constructive criticism .
we are against using the national presumption for the transfer , the transfer of those who use it without rule , and the lack of public control .
&quot; the istenen wealth fund can only help if these concerns are addressed , &quot; he said .
he was found to have worked towards reaching a compromise between the akp and the opposition on the proposal .
&quot; we have investments that demonstrate the confidence in turkey
&quot; the investment of 30 billion tl over the past five years showed our country &apos;s confidence in the future , &quot; ford automotive board president ali koc said at a meeting in istanbul .

&quot; we are putting our trust and trust with our partners in our countries , not only in the so @-@ called language , but also with our investments and fate , &quot; ali koc said at the meeting .
the 30 billion tl investment we have over the past five years demonstrates our country &apos;s confidence in the future .
if turkey does not find itself to attract more foreign investment , it is a must -- a reliable and fair legal system , one that promotes democracy in international standards , qualified labour and r &amp; d , innovations , entrepreneurship , eneurship and value @-@ added value .
in the past few years , our government has presented our most comprehensive incentives in our history of the republic .
&quot; i believe that we will be able to launch a new &apos; investment move &apos; that we need these incentives and territorial strategies , &quot; he said .
&quot; no more incidents are known now , not only a problem for a single country , but as global players , &quot; siemens industrial and trade council president and ceo huseyin gelis said .
we came to turkey with a long @-@ term outlook .
our problems will be solved , if we have in unity and draw .
we were not able to bring in these lands , which were 160 years ago in turkey .
we will continue to go on in these areas .
&quot; of course we will build factories , but our scourge should be clear in this area , &quot; he said .
turkey is one of the top 10 countries for themselves , shell turkey country president ahmet erdem said . &quot; turkey is among the 10 priority countries for shell , &quot; he added .
we believe in the potential and future of turkey .
we have invested and continued to do so in several areas , especially energy .
&quot; thank the president , our prime minister and our ministers for supporting international investors .
efforts are being made for international investors .
&quot; this is the direction to improve our country &apos;s competitiveness , &quot; he said .

because ceo &apos;s arrival was very important .
the bullet side car had asked for protection .
then when it took place , he saw that everything was normal .
he left his bodyguard and car and was happy to return home .
investment in a country is similar to marriage .
first , if everything goes well , you are engaged in a dogmatic and long @-@ term plan .
we are married to turkey and have no intention of divorcing .
the gap was turned into an item !
prime minister binali yildirim was speaking to businessmen by attending an consultation conference on &quot; people who have confidence in turkey , &quot; held by the istanbul industrial chamber at swiss hotel .
turkey &apos;s industry , according to prime minister yildirim yildirim , is the industrial sector that will lead to the state of its own . &quot; we should also keep in place the transition from the industrial sector to 4.0 , &quot; he added .
&quot; the value of added value is high , if it is important to serve as an engine of our country , and if it is important to achieve the 2023 goals , we will think about the industrial revolution , it and technology revolution , that &apos;s what we need to achieve . &quot;
&quot; those who are trying to destroy our country &apos;s future , striving to destroy our democracy , blocking our gazi assembly , but they didn &apos;t give up on our quarry , but today we are talking about another turkey , &quot; he added , adding that turkey was returning to a large gap by the end of july 15th night .
we would talk about a turkey among the 3rd world countries that has been dealt with with in the coup management , have deteriorated national willpower , and have fallen out of the lithuanian league .
&quot; we gave allah the statement , with the dedication of our nationality , our nationality , chief commander , our president , mr. recep tayyip erdogan &apos;s dedication and commitment to our government , &quot; he said .
&quot; we will step in from the impact of this phenomenon and look ahead . &quot;
we are always living under a constant coup , and never is accurate .
we have very ambitious goals ahead .
the coup attempt has shaken turkey &apos;s economy .
kaos and those who expected a crisis once again were lit .
our democracy is also the spectrum of deviation in our economy today .
the banking sector continues to operate in a healthy way , in our financial sector .
the foreign trade deficit in 2015 was down by 25 per cent .
the current account deficit amounted to 5.8 per cent in 2014 , while in 2015 the figure has dropped to 4.5 per cent .
we aim to decrease the goal to 4 by the end of this year .
we will never change our hard line at public finances .
turkey &apos;s budget of 2016 has also been higher than 130 other national income .
we have reduced the national income ratio to 1.3 per cent in 2015 and are striving to keep those rates .
we have a better state of the public debt than the eu , a lot more than the world &apos;s .
our banking sector continues to be on a solid footing .
&quot; despite our central bank , on july 15th , we did not need to exchange the market and our reserves any decrease , but we have a reserve reserve of over $ 121 billion . &quot;
&quot; we are also carrying out comprehensive arrangements for the sake of better economy , for the sake of greater production and creation of new jobs , &quot; said prime minister yildirim yildirim .
we have adopted , and will continue to do so , as we have implemented a lot of arrangements until the repairs of stockpile of stocks and unpaid tax debts .

turkey does not sever western turkey , does not give up the european union
mehmet simsek : turkey does not sever from the west , does not give up on the european union
&quot; those who rely on turkey , &quot; organised by deputy prime minister mehmet simsek , science and technology minister faruk ozlu , economy minister nihat zebekci , ( iso ) , attended a meeting on the &quot; manufacturers in turkey , &quot; held by turkish industrial chamber of commerce ( iso ) .
&quot; i think there will be a lot of spectacular consequences for developments on the night and after 15 july , &quot; science and technology minister faruk ozlu said at the meeting .
the bottom line is that undoubtedly whole union and affirmation , which all of turkey feels deeply protectable at the moment .
the 15 july process has shown how robust the turkish economy has to build on , and how interoperable , democracy has been .
&quot; for a society that achieved this level in the economy and democracy , the next process will be better and easier to move forward , &quot; he said .
&quot; you need to get rid of turkiye that magic . &quot;
nonetheless , the 15 july coup d &apos;affaires from faruk ozlu are hard to explain to the world , according to turkish economy minister nihat zeyubekci , who his government declared a mobilisation of the issue .
zejubekci also highlighted the recent interest discrepancies launched by the banks , &quot; if 63.4 % of the first five percent of the real sector is going to honouring , we should concentrate all our power on this job , &quot; zebekci said .
for him , the president has returned , returning and work .
with the real sector , the banking system , with its government , politics , july 15th , is something that turkey has found unity and equilibria after the turkish civil democratic revolution .
and we welcome recent developments .
&quot; the monthly zero point in the period ahead with the encouragement of our president is for nine per cent ; and we will support this competition as an economic management , as eight of them , and we will carry out its sustainability , continuity and structure of power , &quot; he said .
&quot; greverb passport will make order for our exporter , &quot; he added .
&quot; in the coming period , we will be a guarantor , &quot; nihat zebekci said , &quot; we will not leave the country , led by our president , for the sake of our prime minister , not , but we will leave no stone unstolen . &quot;
we will leave no one we are in contact to increase our trade .
&quot; we will never and will never tolerate it ; we will not be the birds after the suspicions in the branch , but also the birds in the hand , &quot; he said .
zebekci also said that a green passport would be given to exporters during the times , adding that &quot; one of the latest decisions would be given to his law , which is now a law on economics ; from our exports , about 17,000 to 20,000 , and the green card which represents this country &apos;s exports from our first point of time , we would carry out our concession . &quot;
&quot; those who have been involved in a pursuit of coup communication require state contact . &quot;
&quot; but behind us , we now have to look at us , &quot; deputy prime minister mehmet simsek said , addressing the 15 july coup attempt and following ohal .
&quot; those who are involved in this coup d &apos;etat should be cleaned by the state , and , more importantly , they needed serious administrative reforms to avoid any attempts to crack down on such a coup , &quot; said simsek , adding that he was responsible for two simple reasons .
and then a state of emergency has been declared , and very serious structural reforms have taken place so far , as a climate necessary for these administrative reforms .
&quot; we have acted , will continue to act in the content of democratic principles and the rule of law , which is subject to all of them , &quot; he said .
asserting that life is normalising in many areas , simsek stressed that there are no small reasons for companies and individuals who have not engaged in financing terrorism .
according to simsek , the foundations of turkey &apos;s democracy are consolidated . &quot; i think the foundations of turkey &apos;s democracy have become solid because when you look at the roots of recent past problems , you will see that the betrayal network has a job .
&quot; thus the removal of this terrorist organisation from the state would strengthen turkey &apos;s democracy , as this period is closed in turkey . &quot;
the foundations of the economy are generally robust , and in no way has come back to normal structural reform agendas without delay , simsek says , adding , &quot; we have turned back to the attention of turkey &apos;s noble agenda , there will be progress in structural reforms . &quot;
structural reforms are already a must , since populism in the world is on the rise .
&quot; turkey can only prepare for the future by reform , &quot; he said .
finally , he stressed that turkey will not disband from the west . &quot; turkey can sometimes be at odds with our western allies , with our friends , but turkey is not discouraged from the west , but it does not give up on the european union , &quot; simsek said .
&quot; we have fiscally put the fish from 25m to the sea , &quot; he added .
in antalya , the 17 @-@ year @-@ old sisyar tayaker was the hospital after froze fisheries from the 25m @-@ high ordeal called &quot; kartal hill . &quot;
in the evening hours of the konyamil sahin , hid with friends in the konyadil sketchs , then scrambling over the 25m @-@ high fortune , known as the &quot; eagle hill . &quot;
&quot; the king of shamil tayyar , a professional swimmer , was right down to the bottom of the sea .
he had difficulty in moving in the sea , and was pushed to the coast by his fellow students , such as his professional swimmer .
the medics , who were replaced by a menu tayyar flag led him to the antalya school of education and research hospital after the interruption .
he was found not to be a vital danger .
a friend of the guard who testified in the police was put up after he jumped a fish from &quot; eagle hill . &quot;
&quot; we are not able to predict that will happen , &quot; he said .

britain must redirect its olympic spirit , expand heathrow
heathrow will offer renovations and prosperity not only to our local communities but also in london , as well as throughout the country .
i think it will be quite attractive to the heathrow , as in london 2012 , where we have made incredible efforts to benefit all nationalities and territories .
the olympics have created great advantages for stratford and the east end .
and we will achieve this again , creating opportunities for the local people and firms close to heathrow .
we will only provide 10,000 new internally for our local community , create 40,000 new jobs and leave no young people jobless at the airport .
as in the case of london before 2012 , some will think the struggle to expand heathrow is too difficult .
i was told that britain was never able to prepare for the games , and that we would be a reality throughout the world .
the suspicions were burned in 2012 and will be seen as a result of heathing in heathing .
there are obstacles that have always to be overcome , but heathrow answers to all questions that have been asked .
as in the olympics , heathrow is not only a few people but a infrastructure project for many .
the expansion gives 180,000 new jobs and an opportunity to create economic growth of 211 billion euros , leaving many skills and jobs both in the airport environment and throughout the united kingdom .
we have a wonderful team from tathrow to t2 , which has been named the world &apos;s best airport terminal for five years , in time for the world &apos;s two fastest track and field , and the implementation of an investment worth 11 billion euros eligible for the budget .
now we are ready to offer a third track track track and field , supported by special investment worth 16 billion euros .
the london 2012 games were a great success for the united kingdom , and i have no doubt that the heathing of heathing will also occur .
it is time for us to create many capabilities and business capacities for the olympic spirit that we will rely on the expansion of heathrow , allowing us to secure our trade future and to take pride in britain .
lord paul deighton is chairman of heathrow &apos;s board and former treasury secretary at the ministry of commerce .
adblock plus &quot; like the keg @-@ fare game &quot; to block facebook ban
according to one of the companies trying to block advertising for online advertisements , the &quot; kedi @-@ fare game &quot; is being remembered .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced it would block publications on its masters &apos; mask today , adck plus published a blog that says users may update their filters in order to stop advertisements in the social network .
facebook said on tuesday that it would change sophisticated codes on the environment to make it more difficult for a portion of the publishers to identify the billboards .
however , he now says he has resolved new codes .
in a blog post @-@ blog message , adblock spokesman ben williams said that &quot; this is going on from the very moment since it &apos;s been invented to prevent a further recurrence of the open source advertisements between the and those who tried to prevent a further recurring between the community and those who tried to prevent them , &quot; and made it possible on facebook &apos;s own solution in a close time .
the involvement of the largest social media company in the world shows how much concern has been raised for the industry by advertisers .
about 200 million people are using publications as a global phenomenon , four times more than that type of software in 2013 , according to a study by pageorgested and adobe last year .
active users and mobile advertisements accounted for 1.03 billion daily on facebook with mobile goods and 84 per cent of facebook &apos;s advertising income .
because mobile advertising is not effective on facebook for the social network and in instagram , the company has been watching the recipients of publications on the table , according to a spokesman .
with facebook seeing it worth investing in such a move , massive advertisements should still be in place .
also on tuesday , facebook said it would update its &quot; advertisements &quot; tool in order to better control the advertisements offered for them .
on thursday , facebook claimed that the new filters of the adck were alarming , and that it would hamper part of the publicity on the site .
&quot; it does not offer good experience to these people and we are planning to deal with this problem , &quot; a facebook spokesman said in a statement , issued with e @-@ mail .
we are focused on creating vehicles such as advertising preferences in order to provide people with coal .
a woman runs out to swiss highway , as the case appears to have committed suicide
at midnight , the victim was on the highway .
in what appears to be a suicide case , police sought earlier thursday people who personally tore up a few cars on the highway on the road .
the incident occurred in the vaud canton near morges , shortly after midnight on thursday .
vaud police said a woman was found &quot; helpless &quot; on the site of the night &apos;s smell and a few cars were hit by her .
a few cars were broken up , including a truck , to the 49 @-@ year @-@ old swedish woman , who was obviously seeking rebellion .
he died on the scene .
police have said they have discussed some of the drivers involved , but some of them have not been identified and have requested that all those involved , including them and involved , resort to themselves .
in a statement , attorney gilles hofstefstefstefstetter told the tribune that &quot; a reasonable &quot; when it comes to situations like this , a criminal prosecution was opened for genes .
it remains to be seen , however , whether drivers involved in the incident will face any charges .
was it possible to avoid before fighting ?
this is what the prosecutor should identify , &quot; he said .
two similar cases during the past five years demonstrate that drivers will not be held responsible .
both cases ( the paper included a person who headed on a road in the dark ) was judgment that it was not normal for drivers to wait that a spread on the highway in the midnight road .
last year , he pleaded not guilty to the death in august 2014 due to a bearings by a policeman who caused a man on his way through a pipe near pajne , in a bath of a1 .
the court said that the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a liquidation and was infiltrating .
the court said that using the middleman &apos;s tool in the response to an emergency call , and that finding a man on his path was &quot; totally exceptional and unpredictable . &quot;
those who were familiar with this incident , which took place near morges on thursday , should police search for 0683 or 3,644 of the seatbelts .
nasa climate model : good measure for life once
according to new nasa climate model projections , there were some conditions for life in venus .
scientists at the nasa goddard institute institute for space space development developed a model to explore venus &apos;s past , using similar instruments and algorics used by climbed scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether venus once had hosted similar conditions similar to those in the world , with warfare , warmth , water and the atmosphere of co2 .
scientists explained the past with a thick spectacular temperature layer of venus .
however , the newest prognosis suggests that , under the venus , it could have had a world @-@ like atmosphere , and could still be slow .
the model also sought the artillery of the old venus .
although the planet may have originated in the region , it may have already been a source of rapid behavior against adequate sea and geographic change .
the old invention was also used to take advantage of a wider sun , which is 30 per cent less lobbying .
&quot; the slow return of the giss model of venus to venetian rule @-@ of @-@ day vigor every two months was bringing the side back to the sun , &quot; giss scientist anthony del genio said in a newsletter .
that , in turn , led to torches such as a umbrella that has spread the face , protecting the face in the face of sun @-@ stricken oil .
as a result , only a few degree of dire temperature temperature today surfaced with the prospect of the world .
the model has brought the introduction of a similar story on the evolutionary that had previously put forward the depot as a hipo for the planet .
although it once had appropriate conditions for life , it has suffered too much water and ultras in the past few years .
the omission was depleted , and the water was burned to light by the light of the limelight .
hydrogen has been exhausted and the carbon @-@ full carbon plain , which only has the lethal effect of lethal greenhouse gas , remains an environment we know today .
researchers shared the results of a new venus climate model in their articles on geophysical research .
patrick roy steps down from avalanche anchor
patrick roy said the team was not given a say in the decision making process , and resigned on thursday from the post of vice president of colorado avalanche and hokey operations .
colorado vice @-@ president / director joe sakic approved this development , and said the club will begin to search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; over the past three years , i have fulfilled my coaching duties as vice president of colorado avalanche , with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said roy , 50 .
i &apos;ve thought how i could improve and how to reach a higher level through the depth of that team during the summer .
achieving this , they must ensure that the vision of koc and vp hoxhaj operations is flawed in a flawed harmony with the organisation &apos;s vision .
it must also have a say in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance .
current conditions have not yet been met .
katan sakic , who joined his team on may 23rd 2013 , thanked roy for his contribution to the team .
&quot; i notified me of my decision today , &quot; he said .

oil workers in the north continue negotiations , suspending strike
the strike was put on hold because of the pay of oil workers in the north sea , and the chief negotiators began to debate a new round of talks .
the strike against the oil field company wood group is phased in platforms in the north sea , operated by the royal dutch shell .
&quot; we have decided to restart the process for the resolution of the existing dispute with the wood group as union and rmt unions , &quot; a joint statement said .
in the next few weeks , we will hold a series of sessions to take a new look at the problems , starting next week .
labour unions have said that this protest in the face of salary cuts that could reach 30 per cent is the first actions since 25 years .
this year , wood group cut by nearly 9 per cent the payments to contractors in the north sea due to adverse pressure on the market .
a 10 per cent cut was also imposed on loads on the coast in 2014 , after the company &apos;s wage cut process .
additional outages , the company said , would provide the company with room for a transition from a difficult period in the market .
shell dismissed thousands of people as part of the integration process with the british energy company bg group , and announced plans to lay off oil and gas operations in the country by 10 .
energy companies are under pressure due to the low price of crude oil , an economic situation caused by britain &apos;s decision to split from the european union in june .
dave anderson , a member of a scottish parliament , is scheduled to meet with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the north sea .
as he says , the north sea is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; we need an effective economy in the north sea and the majority not for the minority in the country as a whole , &quot; he said in a statement .
despite the average investment of around $ 7 billion over the past five years , new projects in the north sea are expected to be less than $ 1.4 billion .
bishops weigh measures team @-@ star stars &apos; return speed
the kepler space telescope helped make scientists the most complete contribution to the return speed of the team star .
new data helps ecologists mourn the team @-@ star stars at a rapid pace and realise the evolutionary times of their return .
&quot; comparing our consequences with star candidacies , a star was able to learn more about the relationship between poultry , age and even the sun system , &quot; luisa rebull , a research scientist at caltech &apos;s centre for red @-@ transnational processing and analysis at the pasadena centre in caltech , said in a newsletter .
the ulker team star is 445 years away from the world .
most of the stars at the team night formed 125m years ago , and are reaching the level of new access .
they return at the highest pace for their lives .
at the peak pace of return , stars at this stage of maturity make up a large amount of star .
these winds have a breaking effect on the stars as they move forward in manyetic areas of the stars .
as a star appears to be old , the speed of return is starting to plummet .
the bishops are measuring the deadline between the apparent viewpoints and the appearance of each star &apos;s feat , such as solar leks .
the latest comeback speed makes it easier for larger stars than smaller ones .
rebull said that the stars were similar to dangling dancers , allowing large ones to return more slowly than just ones .
&quot; we see that those who are slowly returning to the ulker &apos; honey are much tougher and very mild stars , &quot; rebull said .
the ulker team has become an ideal coin lab for comparing the pace of return , with its proximity as long as it is too close .
&quot; ulker is young and older of the team star , providing theoretical models for star returns in both directions , &quot; rebull said .
it is much more that we want to know how to speed up their return speed , how and when it ended up , and then we &apos;d like to know why &apos; we left their dance shoes &apos; a dog .
rebull and his colleagues described the latest analysis of the team &apos;s return speed with details available in the three new articles to be published in the magazine of astronomical .
