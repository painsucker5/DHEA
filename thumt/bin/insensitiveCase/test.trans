vac@@ ant san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co , 28 , found dead at san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co shopping m@@ all
a recently moved to san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co , the 28 @-@ year @-@ old vac@@ c@@ ine was found dead this week in the fo@@ ot of a local shopping m@@ all .
however , the victim &apos;s brother , his brother , said he was not aware that it would be someone to harm him . in the end , he was doing a good job for him , he added .
the san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co for@@ en@@ sic medical association said wednesday morning that the body , found at the we@@ st@@ fi@@ el@@ d shopping centre , was found to belong to frank gal@@ ic@@ ia , 28 .
the san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co police directorate said the cause of murder was determined and that research is still ongoing .
his brother , lou@@ is gal@@ ic@@ ia , a brother of the victim , told k@@ go fran@@ c@@ is@@ co &apos;s ab@@ c station at san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co that frank , previously working as m@@ ini @-@ chief of the m@@ ot@@ or in bos@@ ton , started work as head of the san fran@@ c@@ is@@ co s@@ ons and da@@ u@@ gh@@ ak department , starting six months ago .
s@@ ons &amp; da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters said the death was &quot; turning into stri@@ fe and was very sad . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team of people who work as a hard family , and he will be very pre@@ t@@ ty n@@ um@@ ber@@ ed , &quot; he said .
we would like to state that at this difficult time that we are not alone for the family and that we have had them .
frank was initially h@@ ou@@ sed in hos@@ te@@ ls , according to lou@@ is gal@@ ic@@ ia . &quot; finally , things were well going to do for him , &quot; he said .
lou@@ is gal@@ ic@@ ia told k@@ go &quot; he had had had had a flat and he had come out with a daughter . &quot;
lou@@ is gal@@ ic@@ ia said he does not think there could be a person who would like to harm his younger brother .
he was a heart , a s@@ pec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar man .
the way to build ties with the family was always to prepare us with a sign , to prepare us a me@@ al , and to make a me@@ al for us , &quot; he said .
he w@@ er@@ en &apos;t th@@ ril@@ led by his in@@ sign@@ ia .
my wife ad@@ jus@@ ted to all situations .
&quot; while everything else in the world was embar@@ ras@@ sed , he was so non@@ ex@@ ist@@ ent every day , &quot; he said .
those who have information were asked to look for the s@@ f@@ pd hr@@ a from the top 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 4@@ 44 tele@@ ph@@ on@@ y .
as@@ pir@@ ing doctors strike : calls for new labour s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing
representatives of the ass@@ ist@@ ants in asia have asked them to allow their trade @-@ off@@ s to slow down the dispute over a new contract .
the committee of doctors in britain ( b@@ ma ) called on the council to support further business s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing , starting in early september .
the j@@ d@@ c said the ministers could not address concerns over the charter .
serbian doctors and medical students voted in favour of the contract with b@@ ma .
this was rejected by 58 % of the eligible members .
in an article published on thursday night in t@@ w@@ it@@ ter , j@@ d@@ c head el@@ len mc@@ cour@@ t said the government was &quot; silent &quot; about the problems caused by the rejection of the contract .
&quot; in this light , the j@@ d@@ c steering board voted in favour of the proposed new contract as whole and called for a re@@ start of formal talks on concerns , &quot; he said .
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the j@@ d@@ c administration sent an official request to allow the b@@ ma board to allow a programme to increase business s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing starting in early september .
the move sparked a six @-@ strike that included the first ar@@ til@@ ler@@ y inter@@ rup@@ tion in the n@@ h@@ s history this year .
as@@ han@@ n mal@@ aw@@ ana , an assistant professor at b@@ ma , resigned after having voted against the contract requirements proposed by b@@ ma .
it was a good agreement that needs to be accepted by members of the b@@ ma during the meetings of 5,000 asian doctors and medical students before they cast their ballots , he said .
following the vote , health minister jer@@ em@@ y hun@@ t said the contract would be applied to doctors in britain .
russia and turkey : are there any al@@ ign@@ ment of a &apos; alliance &apos; ?
it was a ge@@ st@@ ure that ended the crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of the eight @-@ month battle with economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the demonstration hall of st. pet@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g &apos;s palace , it was obvious that ankara had the most desi@@ ra@@ ble side for that compromise .
he was caught , yes .
but mr. putin &apos;s s@@ m@@ ile was quite we@@ ster@@ n@@ ised and it would have been said to have spread any tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure towards his own limited standards .
on the contrary , recep tayyip erdogan spoke several times about &quot; good friend &quot; mr. putin ; he was five times , according to a report .
i was surprised by the number of me .
he also pledged that relations with russia will not return to the pre @-@ crisis level , but to reach much higher levels .
the next day , a daily newspaper there said mr. erdogan acted as if there was no bad thing .
i think he was very ex@@ cited about it .
but mr. putin &apos;s cold su@@ bur@@ b , which the russian leader had done nothing , had shown that he did not forget about anything .
in fact , the first thing turkey mentioned in an opening statement was the cause of the crisis : that turkey shot down the russian war@@ head on the border with syria .
russia &apos;s response to the move was then hi@@ d@@ de@@ t .
mr. putin made a strong breakthrough , accusing ankara of s@@ mu@@ g@@ g@@ ling moscow from s@@ us@@ pen@@ ding .
fra@@ u@@ gh@@ t has become much bigger and cen@@ tr@@ al@@ ised as a friend of the opposing side .
real reconstruction of the trust will be difficult , perhaps impossible .
since november , the idea for the russian people has changed .
state @-@ controlled media have targeted ankara for months of b@@ l@@ ur@@ red and aggressive .
su@@ d@@ den@@ ly , turks were the blame for everything .
the most serious of them were accusations by senior officials that mr. erdogan &apos;s family made profit from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so @-@ called islamic state in syria .
he fla@@ tly rejected it .
however , the official message from st. pet@@ er@@ s@@ bur@@ g was that it was time to proceed .
finally , the reason for that meeting was that mr. putin had sought by president erdogan .
russia could see this as a kind of victory .
for ankara , the benefits of a ceasefire call are very clear .
first , erdogan needs friends following his failure to strike a coup that may have led to his overthrow last month .
terrorist attacks in turkey have long affected him .
in addition , economic reasons are active .
russia &apos;s sanctions have been tight -- especially , ban@@ ning special flights that carry a few million russian tourists in turkey &apos;s coastal region every year .
that number has dropped by almost 90 % .
in russia , tour operators and le@@ as@@ ing companies were definitely reli@@ ev@@ ed that flights would continue .
they have been ag@@ h@@ ast at the end of the season in the mediterranean .
this week , state @-@ run tv predicted that with a re @-@ admission of turkish agricultural products , the prices of fruit and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les would be de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
&quot; tourists are there , &quot; the daily ve@@ de@@ mos@@ ti quoted him as telling the newspaper &apos;s news .
however , there was a separate political value for moscow .
ankara is angry with the west for not having enough reactions to the coup attempt .
mr. putin , who wants to capital@@ ise on the break @-@ up and stan@@ do@@ ff with the west , is taking steps , as long @-@ standing anger over talks on the us prospects for joining the group .
after a coup attempt , the russian leader appears to have certainly gathered symp@@ ath@@ ies from ankara , citing a call to support elected officials .
it was inevitable , no , and then it was inevitable for moscow , which had a deep fear of regime change .
this summit held in the seaside palace , con@@ currently represents a &quot; al@@ ign@@ ment &quot; alliance of the two countries , which russia and turkey say to me : rejected by the west and where they are m@@ ist@@ re@@ ating .
despite this consensus , however , they are far different .
one of the most important is syria : moscow has proposed itself as a mediator , but russia and turkey support the different sides .
after almost three hours of talks , the two presidents also said at a press conference that they did not address the issue .
turkey &apos;s president has clearly avoided an@@ s@@ w@@ ering a question of those differences , while mr. putin has chosen to under@@ line them .
there is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in syria .
but when it comes to months of open an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ties -- and in view of the absolute pre@@ ci@@ p@@ it@@ ation that turkey &apos;s possible de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion by turkey , a nato member , is certainly starting to talk at least about the potential for a russian fi@@ gh@@ ter .
ro@@ yal@@ ty bank ru@@ ined in s@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ s@@ h for customers outside the s@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ s@@ h
the r@@ bs brand , according to the president of the bank executive board , will continue to maintain its back@@ up position .
the royal bank of s@@ c@@ ot@@ land will dis@@ appear for customers except for s@@ c@@ ot@@ land .
the deal , ros@@ s m@@ ce@@ w@@ an said , was related to the bank &apos;s global prospects for s@@ c@@ bs .
because he was almost dis@@ cour@@ aged eight years ago , it was forced to pull out and give up .
during that time , mar@@ ka strategy experts used the &apos; r@@ bs &apos; to maintain other consumer financial bran@@ ds .
it was supported by millions of ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es for sp@@ on@@ sor@@ s from the six @-@ nation ra@@ g@@ bi championship to the w@@ im@@ ble@@ don andy mur@@ ray championship .
now , however , it was determined that it would be right for more national bran@@ ds to emerge .
the new beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings will be used by the royal bank &apos;s s@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ s@@ h clients , but will not be made .
except for their condition of central and p@@ ay@@ r@@ ol@@ l in the uk and gal@@ ler , all hor@@ ses carried out to the r@@ bs would be alter@@ ed as nat@@ west .
the si@@ g@@ nat@@ or@@ ies of the irish republic and northern ireland are already used for a s@@ ter bank brand .
there are smaller bran@@ ds to assume a much more domin@@ ant post for the individual banking field ; co@@ ut@@ ts , ada@@ m &amp; co , dr@@ um@@ mon@@ d and hol@@ t &apos;s militants bank are also present .
mr. m@@ ce@@ w@@ an , in@@ ver@@ ne@@ ss @-@ shi@@ re held an interview for customers and staff .
&quot; the r@@ bs brand will now be our investor brand , after which our personnel are employed , &quot; bbc to s@@ c@@ ot@@ land told s@@ c@@ ot@@ land .
as the bank itself became a global brand , r@@ bs has become the global brand .
i say we are our local goals , not global .
each of these bran@@ ds will represent a bit different in the community , working with our staff under the name of our clients .
the r@@ bs announced that it would not continue its sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ship at the six @-@ nation championship and would raise the profile of different bran@@ ds when it comes to sports sp@@ on@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; now we &apos;ve come to get into the mar@@ kal@@ ar bank understanding because ( we asked ourselves ) how can we do it a better bank for customers ? &quot; he said .
i found it to be a huge bank for our customers three years ago and if we had indicated that we would have made such bran@@ ds .
however , i think you will see a lot of changes , focused on the needs of the customers , not on how we conduct it .
we can re@@ activ@@ ate these bran@@ ds , so i think it &apos;s the right time .

jo@@ key fran@@ ki@@ e de@@ t@@ tor@@ i won his 30@@ 0@@ 0th victory in britain on friday in new@@ mar@@ ket .
on the local run@@ way , john gos@@ den &apos;s pre@@ dil@@ ec@@ ture and the second @-@ place fin@@ is@@ her won their two @-@ kil@@ o victory , reaching that milestone .

&quot; this is a special situation , &quot; said jo@@ key , who formerly won three championship vic@@ tor@@ ies in g@@ ha@@ y@@ j@@ ar .
i have been very emo@@ tional for my parents being here
i really feel g@@ la@@ d to see this happen in the new@@ market i started 30 years ago .
this is not a crucial meeting , but a royal as@@ co@@ t -- it &apos;s just about 20,000 people -- friday night .
i feel com@@ promised and reli@@ ev@@ ed .

les@@ ter p@@ ig@@ t &apos;s career , which won nine times in the magazine competition , has 4@@ 4@@ 93 vic@@ tor@@ ies .
fran@@ ki@@ e is one of the best jo@@ ke@@ ys of our time , and it is not surprising to achieve a kil@@ o@@ me@@ tr@@ e that only a few people have reached before him .
he owns it and is a strong person , but tac@@ tical mentality that con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes to heavy pressure from others on the term .
she represents the hor@@ se of the hor@@ se ; her ex@@ ci@@ te@@ ment and char@@ t is running the sport .
a few weeks ago , i said the ep@@ so@@ m might have achieved 6@@ 0@@ 0th victory in fran@@ ki@@ e without a jo@@ ke competing in the late weeks and big com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions .
to be serious , fran@@ ki@@ e had won most of the 30 years of con@@ te@@ stan@@ t in fran@@ ki@@ e , the united kingdom , with many of them winning , it &apos;s very good to see .
he has a very ex@@ citing character and is a very good character@@ istic of this british competition , which goes beyond it .
fran@@ ki@@ e de@@ t@@ tor@@ i celebrated the chan@@ ge@@ over with the at@@ tan movement , be@@ st@@ ling it that had become a symbol of that milestone .
from its ar@@ ran@@ ged com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions , he had become a symbol of british dis@@ ability , 20 years after a series of in@@ stan@@ ces in their lan@@ ding with ri@@ b@@ b@@ ons .
it was a stu@@ b@@ born way that was stu@@ ck .
in 1996 , he won several major ra@@ ces including a victory of the ren@@ a@@ t &apos; great &apos; brand &apos; but remained alive in a plane crash and was banned due to a lack of compliance with the drug ban .
three years ago , during the rever@@ sal of this six @-@ month @-@ long re@@ integration process , he showed that he had a strong character required to un@@ fairly dis@@ regard the suspected ones and return to the best .
and he could continue for another time ; he had previously said he was willing to stay in the competition until at least 50 .
russia &apos;s putin sa@@ cks private he@@ ir ivanov
russian president vladimir putin un@@ expec@@ te@@ d@@ ly dismissed one of his special he@@ i@@ ghts , ivanov .
mr. ivanov was part of a ci@@ r@@ c@@ le sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ded by mr. putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old is now tasked as a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
mr. putin &quot; has decided to end ivanov &apos;s position as head of the russian leadership , &quot; but no cause was given , the kre@@ m@@ l@@ in said in a statement .
an@@ ton va@@ ino , who has been acting as a car@@ et@@ ak@@ er to mr. ivanov since 2012 , has been assigned to do so .
va@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
in 19@@ 7@@ 2 , tal@@ lin@@ n , estonia , was born in the capital of tal@@ lin@@ n , where the prominent moscow state institute gra@@ du@@ ated from the department of international relations ( m@@ g@@ im@@ o ) , and served at the embassy in to@@ ky@@ o .
he was later interested in the presidential protocol and the management of the government &apos;s staff ; that is his wor@@ ding on the kre@@ m@@ l@@ in web site ( russia ) .
&quot; i thank me because you trust me , &quot; said mr. putin after his appointment .
i think your main task is to support your activities as head of the state in terms of keeping the law and monitoring the implementation of instruc@@ tions .
mr. putin announced on friday that he had asked the russian tv station mr. ivanov to withdraw and suggested mr. va@@ ino for the replacement .
convincing s@@ mil@@ es ?
that is a move that has shocked moscow .
ser@@ ge@@ i ivanov has long worked as one of vladimir putin &apos;s cl@@ os@@ est allies and served as the soviet security forces force k@@ g@@ b .
special heart was one of the most powerful people in the country .
in a televised session with putin , both voiced confidence about his choice for private heart .
however , despite the s@@ mil@@ es used to the cameras , few are convinced , especially at this time of parliamentary elections .
but is there a dispute due to such a power struggle ?
no one knows this yet .
however , the official statement that a person who might be chairman would like to re@@ direct russia &apos;s environmental policy has raised s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism .
mr. ivanov , according to the kre@@ m@@ l@@ in website , was quoted as telling mr. putin : &quot; in early 2012 , it &apos;s difficult for us to speak -- even more difficult -- that i trust me for the next four years for the post .
e@@ h , according to her , i served four years as a special pre@@ text at the helm for eight months .
mr. ivanov took up that post in december 2011 .
he had previously served as deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a former member of the k@@ g@@ b state security forces , like a russian security council member and mr. putin .
at the end of the 1990s , mr. putin was head of the federal security forces ( f@@ s@@ b ) , which replaced the k@@ g@@ b , while mr. ivanov was acting as acting acting acting acting acting acting minister .
once mr. putin passed power , he cited ivanov as one of the five most tr@@ us@@ ted people .
mr. ivanov might have been president following mr. putin &apos;s second term , since mr. putin &apos;s third term as president was un@@ constitutional .
however , his mandate was handed over to another close ally , d@@ mit@@ ry medvedev .
mr. putin became prime minister three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency .

ab@@ c stu@@ di@@ os and c@@ bs tele@@ vision , who produced the series , have announced a joint statement that he is being fired .
re@@ vi@@ b@@ son , which re@@ vi@@ ves private ag@@ an a@@ ar@@ on hot@@ ch@@ ner , had an ap@@ ology on tuesday before the fe@@ si@@ gh announcement .
differences over cre@@ ative issues and a conflict were added .
&quot; i am sor@@ ry that such an incident occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
one th@@ or@@ ny of ab@@ c stu@@ di@@ os and c@@ bs tele@@ vision stu@@ di@@ os is said to have detailed information about how to remove a group of f@@ bi f@@ bi agents from the programme that has played .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old actor , who had previously been on a co@@ me@@ dy for the situation d@@ har@@ ma &amp; gre@@ g , was involved in the programme since the first season in 2005 .
&quot; i love the cri@@ p@@ p@@ le min@@ ds and worked for the past two years by giving him the per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance and sou@@ l , &quot; gi@@ b@@ son said in a statement issued on friday .

i just want to thank the authors , the filmmakers , our great team , and , most importantly , the best supporters that a programme can have .
the programme is expected to return to the ov@@ ens for the second round on september 28th .

qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ fer@@ ry parade : bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe
worth 1.@@ 35 billion euros , project needs to be completed by may 20@@ 17
engineers have combined the northern part of the qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ fer@@ ry line , which means the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
this is the first of four closed cl@@ os@@ ures between the &quot; tab@@ le@@ ts &quot; that will be completed in the vic@@ in@@ ity of each of the bridge &apos;s three to@@ w@@ ers .
ke@@ h@@ iti , from fi@@ fe , is 6@@ 0@@ 0m long and 30,000 tonnes of we@@ d@@ ding .
there are 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cab@@ les .
the project , worth 1.@@ 35 billion euros , must be completed by may 20@@ 17 .
economy minister ke@@ it@@ h bro@@ wn was among the first people to walk through the road , visiting facilities today .
&quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ fer@@ ry parade .
we are all mas@@ ters of engineering with this project , which used only more than 30,000 tonnes to build only this segment of the bridge , and we are really de@@ st@@ ined in ex@@ cel@@ len@@ ce .
despite the ex@@ cep@@ tional di@@ men@@ sion and weight of the bridge , which cl@@ os@@ es the gap between the valley and the bridge bat@@ tal@@ ion , it is a sensitive work that requires extremely sensitive tolerance for this adjustment .
in all , 79 % of the total bridge bat@@ tal@@ ion is now in place , meaning that the entire bat@@ tal@@ ion will be available to remove the entire co@@ ff@@ in from the fo@@ il today in ros@@ y@@ th .
&quot; in all projects of bridges , the closing is always an important milestone .
this ex@@ cep@@ tional project represents its predecessor in the civil engineering .
we had to close the gap on the north -- or in the car@@ pe@@ t -- after it was placed in the final road bat@@ tal@@ ion and linked to the level of the en@@ lar@@ ged north to@@ w@@ er .
that , in turn , was realised when the valley in the north pul@@ led from 7@@ 0@@ 0m to about south .
it was only a very deli@@ cate procedure , but also a very deli@@ cate process .
the main reason was the need for the valley to be 2@@ 2m tal@@ l , almost 6,000 tonnes of we@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ lifting and to withdraw in about 3 % .
the deli@@ cate reason was that the team &apos;s tolerance values it must a@@ bi@@ de by were very low , with only a few mil@@ li@@ metres on both sides .
for@@ tun@@ ately , everything went on track .
mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e g@@ ul@@ f rescue team : &apos; lu@@ ck@@ y &apos; because three men are alive
the three men were &quot; lu@@ ck@@ y because they survived &quot; by their f@@ is@@ her@@ men at an@@ g@@ le@@ se@@ y .
mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e r@@ n@@ li li@@ man@@ i issued an alert friday to the british summer go@@ al@@ ke@@ e@@ per at 13 : 20 pm after being hit by the de@@ bac@@ le in the ther@@ mo@@ electric g@@ ul@@ f of ter@@ ti@@ ary .
the three had been stri@@ ving to sw@@ im into a safe field while the vessels were still on their own .
&quot; we have seen that the te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que has drawn up the right bodies to them , and we have covered the an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y , &quot; he said , re@@ taining the court &apos;s control .
&quot; for@@ tun@@ ately , we moved away with strong win@@ ds , ranging from the right road to the right one , &quot; he added .
two of them were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local f@@ is@@ her@@ men , while a third , a 60 @-@ year @-@ old boy , was found to have spent a box office without her death .
they were all brought to a li@@ fe@@ time @-@ ro@@ o@@ f@@ ing fleet to the coast , and brought to the li@@ f@@ el@@ ine movie station station .
&quot; the three men who have fallen into the water are lu@@ ck@@ y because they are alive and have never served .
in the boat engine , an emergency was a night@@ m@@ are to stop the situation , but it should have so@@ unded by a person who used the boat when the ves@@ sel was buy it .
this three men were watching each other today .
a valuable au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary form , po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on go for health and hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s
it is deeply condemned to see how the world has really changed .
young people and children no longer go out to play for the game , chose to spend their free time looking at the s@@ cre@@ ens , many felt sor@@ ry over the past decade .
po@@ ke@@ m@@ on would encourage gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tors to move from the bottom .
time spent looking at the s@@ cre@@ ens , with the latter limited to television , the video games , and finally spread to s@@ mar@@ t phones .
for this reason , it is really great to see that there are no sub@@ stan@@ tive factors in moving technology and open air .
of course , i would talk about po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on go , a practice based on char@@ ac@@ ters , play@@ off@@ s , play@@ wright cards and other affili@@ ations that were created in the 1990s , especially created for the video play game .
like many ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ a of popular culture , this new game included an average of views when it was presented in the us , australia and new ze@@ al@@ and in early july .
later , their presentation was postponed in other countries due to the strong interest that prompted over@@ lo@@ ad .
within days , po@@ é@@ m@@ on go tin@@ der has more than the same number of users than that of its t@@ w@@ it@@ ter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players come by telephone with their in@@ te@@ l@@ li@@ gent phones to look for po@@ m@@ me@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on , followed by the g@@ ps , and can call &apos; look at their cl@@ ou@@ ds &apos; ( with look up in the phone ) or &apos; . &apos;
for a younger generation who played for the play , he was can@@ di@@ d and participated in this cra@@ d@@ le .
in the united states , the play &quot; average &quot; has significantly increased the number of steps a person has taken daily .
car@@ di@@ o@@ gra@@ m , a project developed for ap@@ p@@ le watch and its 3@@ 5,000 users , monitoring 3@@ 5,000 users , said that the percentage of people who un@@ eg@@ ged in the next two days between them in the wake of the washington post , cli@@ m@@ bed from 45 per cent to 53 per cent a day .
the company does not know who played po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on go , but only at an un@@ la@@ w@@ ful level , in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion .
the public health campaign , which encouraged people to &quot; separate 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; get out of the law &quot; and &quot; active every day , &quot; was ignored because most public health messages were ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led and m@@ ist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly con@@ ve@@ yed by the con@@ tested individuals .
still , the importance of eg@@ zero remains to be seen .
the chances of individuals holding regularly without eg@@ gs , cancer or de@@ pression are de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
he helps with issues such as eg@@ z@@ er@@ y , high blood pressure , di@@ a@@ be@@ tes and di@@ a@@ be@@ tes , as well as a list of benefits that cannot be listed there .
however , the beauty of po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on go is to get people out in order to do something they enjoy .
in this way , three key aspects of health are also covered : movement , clean air and sun li@@ ghts , and entertainment .
some are able to obtain new friends during the hun@@ t .
as usual , there are in@@ sur@@ gen@@ ts seeking something to complain .
and of course it can be s@@ pec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar at the door as one pro@@ g@@ res@@ ses .
what makes a difference ?
a major innovation was presented .
the w@@ ise phone practices , such as f@@ it@@ bit , had to offer us no reason to be ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted as this game .
the impact of innovation and use will decline , and will decline over time .
but due to the success of po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ on , implementation and virtual reality will be brought in to a host of plays that are helping to be more active , for@@ bi@@ d@@ den and healthy , by com@@ b@@ ining ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m in real world activities .

with a total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 , al@@ y ra@@ is@@ man , a silver me@@ dal@@ ist and friend of the &quot; last five &quot; team , and ali@@ ja mustaf@@ ina , the russian bronze me@@ dal@@ ist .
si@@ mon@@ e bil@@ es of the united states performed as a balance in the women &apos;s artistic gymnastics final at the 20@@ 16 ri@@ o de jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o summer olympics in brazil on thursday .
bil@@ es was the fourth and fifth americans , who received the prize for general assessment in the background and announced it as best for her own gener@@ ator and , perhaps , the best of all time .
the last time was based on their te@@ ars , which came to an end by long ago .
this achievement has raised the level to the same level as athletes , such as michael p@@ helps , who can be seen once in every generation that brings sports to new levels :
bil@@ es described the last three years as one of the most successful athletes , including 15 gold , and the 1984 olympic champion mary lo@@ u re@@ t@@ ton , who named him &quot; the best g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast i have seen so far . &quot;
he was waiting for a last test in brazil -- it was more bur@@ den@@ some than among those in the area of tickets and other people in the field .
he was likely to be seen as a disappointment that would see his family home in the spr@@ int with a hand@@ ful of gold medals .
the united states &apos;s si@@ mon@@ e bil@@ es , left , and al@@ y ra@@ is@@ man , won the gold and silver medal in the overall assessment of women in artistic gymnastics at the 20@@ 16 ri@@ o de jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o summer olympics in brazil , respectively .
bil@@ es won first place on tuesday , when he was serving as a ce@@ le@@ br@@ atory sign in the far@@ e@@ well party of retired national team co @-@ ordinator mar@@ th@@ a kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i .
though bil@@ es insisted that he had never seen any further in this long run on his way , his position is not fully ac@@ cur@@ ate .
the portion , which includes the sw@@ ol@@ len practice of at@@ z@@ er@@ os that had become a symbol of your sou@@ l , was worked with latin music that would fully adap@@ t to the street just outside ri@@ o olympic arena .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
the girl , whose mother @-@ in @-@ law was admitted to a smaller child by her great father and grand@@ father , was found on a tour of the ic@@ on in a gymnastics hall where ai@@ me@@ e bo@@ de@@ fore@@ station co@@ ach@@ ed .
since the summer of 2013 , they have not lost one of the general as@@ se@@ s@@ ments , making it a win to continue as long as they want to know .
mustaf@@ ina was the leader in two p@@ ath@@ s , but this was a parade .
the balance be@@ am and in@@ e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ical fa@@ ir@@ y@@ tal@@ s that bil@@ es won the world championship title have not yet been made .
the balance event scored a score of 15.@@ 4@@ 33 , which included 15.@@ 9@@ 33 points .
ra@@ is@@ man was shak@@ en up to the end of the score , waiting for ne@@ z@@ ak@@ e@@ ten , and bil@@ es once written a s@@ me@@ ar book , while the s@@ pec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar red on the out@@ door side of the light red , white and blue se@@ at@@ bel@@ t .
ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was like a re@@ fle@@ ction of the performance four years ago , when he lost his fourth place and then lost the bronze to mustaf@@ ina .
this time around , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , named &quot; nine , &quot; had passed it .
time around , he sent a re@@ lic to the crowd after a see@@ min@@ g@@ ly suspicious return to the crowd .
for bil@@ es , 19 @-@ year @-@ old t@@ we@@ et is very much shared earlier this week that it is now completely new .
police : 3 sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce victims highlighted in ser@@ ial kil@@ ler &apos;s case , l@@ ist@@ en@@ ing to music
two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl was shot in p@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x &apos;s first case of a ser@@ ial kil@@ ler in ten years , where he was speaking in the car on thursday , according to police reports .
on june 12th , officials said , the daughter of angela ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le , ste@@ f@@ an@@ ie r@@ . el@@ lis and el@@ lis , mal@@ e@@ ah , was shot in the car along a wa@@ i@@ ter road .
the report says that the gun@@ man was standing on the passenger side of the car , shooting eight sh@@ ots at p@@ ist@@ ol and moving away with another vehicle .
police say they did not appear ma@@ ture to have committed these three murders because they did not receive all hand bags or $ 2,@@ 900 money from aggressive ad@@ ul@@ t victims .
a spokesman for the p@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x police , commissioner j@@ on@@ a@@ than ho@@ ward , said that the gun attack was directed by researchers to examine whether it was connected to the previous four attacks .
in all , seven people were killed and two others were injured in the nine attacks on ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds in we@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ lifting , in which they lived mainly in spanish or@@ ig@@ ins .
&quot; this was a settlement in front of a house , &quot; ho@@ ward said earlier this month , before a c@@ bs inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator .
the suspect is thought to have used a few vehicles that include a black and white c@@ ad@@ il@@ la@@ c or l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n in a model towards the end of 1990 .
the researchers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were related to the same kil@@ ler and carried out by the same kil@@ ler .
el@@ lis ( 33 ) was admitted to hospital for their injuries , and he was subsequently killed .
lin@@ er ( 31 ) and el@@ lis &apos; daughter , mal@@ e@@ ah , were killed on the scene .
one person who was involved in the incident said that it was not unusual for them to listen to music by sitting in the park that they had par@@ ked .
at the same time , authorities published a police report on the case of the shooting against a truck that targeted three hours earlier than three killings .
researchers found shel@@ ls , issued a co@@ me@@ dy from a seat and located s@@ cat@@ tered pieces in the di@@ vi@@ ding of m@@ ot@@ or .
the 6 @-@ year @-@ old mother of mi@@ kr@@ os@@ ef@@ ali says &quot; a better situation &quot;
like many six @-@ year @-@ old children , ed@@ m@@ und pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to li@@ ke@@ s sin@@ ging , sin@@ ging his to@@ ys and , of course , the mother .
however , in ed@@ m@@ und to ed@@ m@@ und , his mother , eli@@ za@@ beth pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to , remains un@@ aware of her presence during the ap@@ par@@ at@@ us , which is a gen@@ e@@ tic dis@@ ability that his mother , eli@@ za@@ beth pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to , had no knowledge of her presence during her pas@@ sion .
when it came back to the house , my first th@@ ou@@ ghts were that i could not be able to do so .
i can &apos;t do that .
i didn &apos;t want that .
these are not true , of course , that &apos;s not true , of course you would like it to , too , &quot; he said .
he and his wife v@@ inc@@ ent have said that ed@@ m@@ und can never recognise them and even survive .
some doctors went as far as to offer the investment in the care house .
&quot; my first reaction was to say that i &apos;m not thinking that people are doing this anymore , &quot; pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said .
ed@@ m@@ und can walk with the help of a f@@ ren@@ ch@@ man .
ed@@ m@@ und was not able to sit down or re@@ ti@@ r@@ e until he turns three , and can still speak .
however , he has been slow in reaching some cr@@ os@@ s@@ roads .
she can walk and bi@@ ke by providing help .
in addition , he li@@ ke@@ s playing and sin@@ ging with his two brothers .
eli@@ za@@ beth points out that ed@@ m@@ un@@ d de@@ serves to give me the song &quot; because it means me sin@@ ging . &quot;
pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told c@@ bs news &quot; we te@@ ach it the sign language . &quot;
as we know , however , ed@@ m@@ und says he is following his own signs .
mi@@ kr@@ os@@ ef@@ ali can come forward with a series of different situations : a gen@@ e@@ tic situation such as ed@@ m@@ und may be present and a source of infec@@ tions that have created f@@ res@@ co@@ es , such as can@@ na@@ bi@@ s and ro@@ di@@ o@@ f@@ s during the ex@@ p@@ i@@ ra@@ tion .
signs and the n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation of the disease could demonstrate a huge difference .
it is still too early to say how life of people with the z@@ ik@@ a infection can be affected .
pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ al@@ ls the emo@@ tional ba@@ by that his future poses in li@@ mb@@ o .
i always asked what &apos;s going to happen .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and he is still un@@ familiar with this .
in fact , i have not asked my father for a long time to tell me that i was really told of the disease .
pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to , however , has been able to present promising recommendations for the mothers of ba@@ bi@@ es , who were the sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion due to z@@ ik@@ a .
a better situation .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will enjoy your children , and you will enjoy you too .
lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , mis@@ sis@@ si@@ p@@ i , hired heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , rescue teams
the heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and widespread water ra@@ inf@@ all in lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana led them to pro@@ claim a state of emergency on friday , when more ra@@ ins were expected by saturday .
national air services reported that there are numerous stones in the numerous rivers south of lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana and mis@@ sis@@ si@@ p@@ i in the northeast , pos@@ ing widespread water following heavy ra@@ inf@@ all .
lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana governor john be@@ l ed@@ war@@ ds said that state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that there is support for the affected ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds .
mi@@ ke ste@@ e@@ le , spokeswoman for the office of governor @-@ general security and emergency preparations , said requests have been made for high water instruments , te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ es and sy@@ rin@@ ges .
only tonnes of sy@@ m@@ pos@@ ium have been sought for the tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a neighbourhood , ste@@ e@@ fo@@ a said .
most of south lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana will be le@@ ased by saturday .
air service said it could rain additional 3 to 5 se@@ at@@ ers on the ground , on the one hand .
at al@@ a@@ ba@@ ma , a water raid was discovered on saturday , as rain continued in the mobile area .
a record level is expected to be reached through the am@@ ite river near the dr@@ . rou@@ ge river and the am@@ ite spr@@ ings near lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , both near lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana .
the two lines could leave many homes in the su@@ bur@@ ban regions near bat@@ on rou@@ ge , according to the predi@@ c@@ tor , al@@ ek kra@@ ut@@ mann .
he also said that the flow of water through the v@@ re@@ p@@ as lake poses a threat to the as@@ si@@ on neighbourhood , which will be slow in mind .
the ti@@ ca river , located just south of the state border , in lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , was already in place friday morning at 9@@ am .
res@@ cu@@ ers continue to carry out water raids in the case of the amp@@ h@@ ora and wil@@ kin@@ son s@@ pe@@ ak@@ ers sou@@ th@@ west of mis@@ sis@@ si@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ i .
he was among those res@@ cu@@ ed near g@@ los@@ ter on friday .
the waters , normal@@ ly from the be@@ av@@ er magazine , 400 feet from her house , were rapidly cli@@ m@@ b with d@@ ry , h@@ an@@ s@@ ford ( 62 ) said .
another son , who is sitting nearby , su@@ ed him .
&quot; we were on alert and the water was continuing to come , &quot; he said .
he was ar@@ ri@@ ving until be@@ li@@ e@@ ver@@ s .
that is the highest level to have been found to have been found in the magazine that he had lived in h@@ an@@ s@@ ford for 48 years , when he was living there , his wife said .
he said he and his family were disabled and that he was the only person to have been facing him .
he said the emergency workers sav@@ ed three with a truck in a great , military @-@ style and took them to the fire station at g@@ los@@ ter , which they got their shelter friday .
as heavy ra@@ ins continue , kra@@ ut@@ mann said , water raids &quot; spread rapidly &quot; and the authorities were considering ev@@ ic@@ ting orders .
he said a observers near li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on had reported 13.@@ 75 inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ated ra@@ inf@@ all from the night until friday .
since wednesday , the ground has been s@@ lu@@ g@@ g@@ ish at a high level , kra@@ ut@@ mann said .
with authorities , heavy ra@@ ins and water prin@@ ting , the tan@@ gi@@ ants of tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a neighbourhood have made it clear that schools in five schools need to be cur@@ ta@@ iled and ta@@ u@@ gh@@ t .
the club is@@ ti@@ r@@ aki w@@ l said that 200 members of a women &apos;s municipal council in tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were under water prin@@ ting .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches , which are now sub@@ mer@@ ged .
the authorities have res@@ cu@@ ed 72 people and seven domestic pe@@ di@@ ments who had been st@@ ran@@ ded for rising water due to the high water supply , said su@@ b@@ by miller , in charge of the neighbourhood .
shel@@ ling for evacu@@ ated in the village of am@@ ite and in the town of ham@@ mon@@ d has been set up .
&quot; when the waters start to fall back , they will be allowed to return home , &quot; he said .
the tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a neighbourhood was closed in the city of ham@@ mon@@ d to nearly two dozen streets due to rising water , and se@@ iz@@ ures were presented to be taken by residents trying to keep water away from their homes and businesses .
&quot; the last big water prin@@ ting was in march , &quot; said city administration official la@@ c@@ y lan@@ d@@ ru@@ d@@ ru@@ m .
that means it will be a similar case .
at mis@@ sis@@ si@@ p@@ i , ru@@ per@@ t la@@ c@@ y , an emergency manager , said the rain on the g@@ ul@@ f coast continues steadily .
a few house can@@ d@@ les were reported to have had water prin@@ ting on tuesday , but until friday there has been no de@@ c@@ lar@@ ations in that direction .
ke@@ it@@ h to@@ w@@ son , the director of the sh@@ op@@ per val@@ u@@ e fo@@ o@@ ds in am@@ ite , has lived there for 40 years .
&quot; i saw that there were water in places where i had never seen any water before , &quot; said to@@ w@@ n@@ son , adding that &quot; and still there is ra@@ inf@@ all . &quot;
ma@@ ha@@ j bro@@ wn , 6 , who was &quot; ba@@ by bul@@ le@@ ts &quot; with his bul@@ let , survived a phil@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical attack
police say they were shot dead at phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a , a 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy , this week in the town .
c@@ bs identified ma@@ ha@@ j bro@@ wn for phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a as his grand@@ father and grand@@ father .
he said that his grand@@ father and grand@@ father had been told to have had multiple fire@@ arms injuries in areas including his body , the per@@ ip@@ her@@ al area , the le@@ g , and his wife , bro@@ wn , but is con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous at his hospital when he was rec@@ over@@ ed .
&quot; he suffered too many pa@@ in and was hor@@ ri@@ fied by sh@@ ru@@ b@@ ber@@ y bul@@ le@@ ts , &quot; said bu@@ y@@ u@@ kan@@ it me@@ len@@ de@@ lo@@ res .
i can &apos;t believe that .
he was listed in the hospital among those that maintain a critical situation , and under@@ went some sur@@ ger@@ ies .
the family said it was expected that the station would improve itself .
he was due to begin the first grade in the local elementary school .
bro@@ wn was one of the four people shot in the ger@@ man@@ to@@ wn area .
they also killed 29 and two men , one at 32 .
c@@ bs phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a said one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is critical , while the other two are in sta@@ bi@@ l .
the boy , he said , was shot in the front arm of a car along with one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men who is critical .
two other victims were not present in the car , and police are investigating whether one of the wo@@ un@@ ds was aggressive .
many armed assa@@ il@@ ants could have fired at c@@ bs phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a , they said .
the place was full of shel@@ ls in a different style of attack weapons on different weapons .
apparently , there was a prot@@ ra@@ cted conflict .
the co@@ b@@ ble@@ stone on the street was st@@ ran@@ ded on both sides of the removal .
this shows there are more than one armed attac@@ kers and both are active , &quot; phil@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a commissioner an@@ th@@ on@@ y g@@ in@@ al@@ di said .
several homes and vehicles across the region were also damaged .
no arrests have been made and police have reportedly ch@@ ec@@ ked security cameras .
the 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was shot in front of her home in the west bor@@ e on tuesday , shooting bul@@ le@@ ts at her arm .
he has made an important question of how and police are still searching for a suspect .
si@@ mon@@ e , g@@ ab@@ by and la@@ ur@@ ie for what we need
this year &apos;s women were the olympic gymnastics team , which i called this , and there are several reasons for that .
first , i had participated in all summer olympics since 1984 , and the united states had never had been so domin@@ ant .
second , this team has three g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ asi@@ ums that in@@ sp@@ ire many girls of ethnic origin : si@@ mon@@ e bil@@ es , g@@ ab@@ by dou@@ g@@ las and la@@ u@@ ren &quot; her@@ nan@@ ie &quot; her@@ nan@@ de@@ mi .
the structure of this team , co@@ al@@ es@@ ce ra@@ is@@ man and catholic ma@@ dis@@ on ko@@ ci@@ an , makes all proud .
the team finally seems to be similar to america .
at the same time , it strengthened the presence that women of si@@ j@@ i and latin @-@ origin hold on top of the sport .
in the past four years , the first woman g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast has always become an american of african origin .
last year , si@@ mon@@ e and g@@ ab@@ by placed 2nd and 2nd in the ranking .
it is a strong thing .
in recent olympics , g@@ ab@@ by dou@@ g@@ las was a surprise olympic champion and backed by america .
si@@ mon@@ e bil@@ es , dou@@ g@@ las and la@@ ur@@ ie her@@ nan@@ de@@ z , now making three world champions , are likely to have played an extraordinary performance of gymnastics r@@ allies that have only un@@ expected .
on thursday , si@@ mon@@ e became the fourth us to win a gold medal in the overall assessment of women .
and his te@@ am@@ ma@@ te , al@@ y ra@@ is@@ man , won the silver .
we know the best times of the sport , but the atmosphere in gymnastics throughout the country does not seem to exist .
si@@ mon@@ e , g@@ ab@@ by and la@@ ur@@ ie had the same path as al@@ y and ma@@ dis@@ on to be part of the olympic teams .
the reason for them to be &quot; last five &quot; will be only four g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast on the next olympic gymnastics team , which will be mar@@ ta kar@@ ol@@ y@@ i &apos;s last year of co@@ ach@@ ing .
in reality , however , gymnastics is highly expensive sport and g@@ y@@ m@@ nas@@ ts are mostly working in private gymnastics clubs , which have more money paid by parents , including education , travel , for@@ ma , competition , hotel fees ( co@@ ach@@ es , g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ asi@@ or@@ ies and families ) , among others .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in the we@@ al@@ th@@ y su@@ bur@@ ban ne@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ working ne@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ working ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bour@@ ho@@ o@@ ds that can handle the business .
these clubs require a costly and long @-@ term commitment to the families of the g@@ y@@ m@@ nas@@ ts , the only place where g@@ y@@ m@@ nas@@ ts can receive training .
si@@ mon@@ e bil@@ es tra@@ in@@ er ai@@ me@@ e bo@@ de@@ v and la@@ ur@@ ie her@@ nan@@ de@@ z &apos;s coach , mag@@ u mag@@ gi@@ e han@@ e@@ y , are instruc@@ ting them since they began m@@ ol@@ y@@ &apos;s g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ asi@@ um .
for the numerous young girls affected by si@@ mon@@ e , g@@ ab@@ by and la@@ ur@@ ie , we do not offer communities an affordable and more ac@@ ces@@ sible gymnastics .
i founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
in my est@@ on@@ ian , har@@ le@@ m @-@ based c@@ er@@ e@@ mon@@ ies offered free and costly gymnastics to over 15,000 young people in the town , among them , and offered co@@ des for both national and international championships .
in september , we will expand to de@@ tro@@ it ( where i am growing ) to present the opportunity to learn this won@@ der@@ ful olympic sport and offer quality gymnastics to young people who de@@ serve the opportunity to benefit from it .
gymnastics , the body &apos;s strength , flexibility and co @-@ ordination , provides hard work , discipline and determination .
this combination offers long @-@ term benefits for success in health care , school and business .
it will be an in@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ tion and a great thing for the team to direct thousands of young girls to the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast .
participation in spor@@ ting activities is especially important for girls .
we are really going through sen@@ sa@@ tional times .
si@@ mon@@ e , al@@ y , la@@ ur@@ ie , g@@ ab@@ by and ma@@ dis@@ on all of them brought in a gold medal as the olympic team , comp@@ el@@ ling for many young girls who clearly showed &quot; the power of the girls &quot; and had different plans to become a healthy and successful young woman .
following jer@@ em@@ y hun@@ t &apos;s rejection of bid , asian doctors agree to go ahead with strikes
the ministers hoped that the dispute would come to an end after the deal was signed with the members of the british con@@ glo@@ mer@@ ate , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ ts who participated in the vote voted against .
in july , mr. hun@@ t announced plans to san@@ ction the contract , st@@ at@@ ing that &quot; no one is located &quot; and that further delay would harm personnel and the patients .
the first su@@ bor@@ din@@ ate group under@@ went a new contract that includes changes in the night and practice of working at the end of the week , in order to improve care out of normal hours .
&quot; there are still serious concerns about the proposed charter of as@@ pir@@ ant doctors , especially that it will trigger the current labour crisis and it does not seem to have an equal attitude towards all the doctors , &quot; according to dr el@@ len mc@@ cour@@ cour@@ t , the head of b@@ ma &apos;s as@@ i doctors committee .
with just eight weeks left to pass a new contract by the first medical group , progress must be made and time is ex@@ ist@@ ent .
b@@ ma &apos;s efforts to settle the dispute were met with the government &apos;s un@@ willingness to establish inter@@ action and , in some cases , with shak@@ y silence .
it is a development despite a promise by jer@@ em@@ y hun@@ t last month that the door should always be open .
&quot; jer@@ em@@ y hun@@ t needs to act now , remove my contract and he@@ ed the concerns of as@@ pir@@ ing doctors . &quot;
there is a clear sign that they are prepared to increase business s@@ lo@@ w@@ ers if they do not do so .
the latest strike in late april forced the almost 13@@ ,000 rout@@ ine operations and the ar@@ ran@@ ge of 100,000 ran@@ do@@ m@@ ers , nurses and consul@@ tan@@ ts to take care of doctors in the strike line .
the ministers hoped that the dispute would come to an end after the contract was signed with the members of the british con@@ glo@@ mer@@ ate .
b@@ ma wants to improve the prices at the weekend for the country &apos;s 5,000 ass@@ ist@@ ants .
the executive board of the n@@ h@@ s employers , daniel mor@@ ti@@ mer , called on as@@ st@@ os doctors not to ex@@ ec@@ ute any strike .
&quot; the strike won &apos;t solve anything , but the hard line is cause for pressure on the team and the services , which would create pressure on them and the services , causing concern , com@@ for@@ t and concern for their families , &quot; said mr. mor@@ ti@@ mer .
over the past two months , we have continued our talks with the as@@ pir@@ ant committee and ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed positively the health ministry and other officials , as well as their concerns about ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ing .
the important issues -- including distribution , education flexibility , education flexibility , training costs for those who inter@@ rup@@ ted in their car@@ e@@ ers , a mutual understanding on the mutual understanding of cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , education permits and the ma@@ ture gender pay gap -- were cited as a positive sign of hope for continued positive action , in november and february by the british ministry of health and education .
during 2 days , sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors could eliminate heart attack danger
thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from two p@@ har@@ ma@@ cies per day after authorities recommended giving more time to the authorities .
re@@ l@@ or , which pre@@ ven@@ ts ab@@ un@@ dance of p@@ ure , re@@ du@@ ces the risk of crisis against individuals who have under@@ gone heart .
he was given for 12 months following the heart crisis , which had to reduce the risk of par@@ al@@ y@@ sis or another crisis .
n@@ h@@ s observers recommended that it be given to people for four years , in order to further reduce the risk of problems with nice , cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular reg@@ ist@@ ra@@ tions .
however , the n@@ h@@ s observers now suggested that it be given to individuals for four years to further reduce the risk of problems in nice , cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from heart attacks every year in the united kingdom , a quarter of which is in another crisis or par@@ al@@ y@@ sis .
cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cular than heart attacks and par@@ al@@ y@@ sis are the reason for the ac@@ cum@@ u@@ lation of ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les on one of the ti@@ r@@ e ar@@ ch walls .
if the pla@@ te falls apart , this could cause blood sa@@ mp@@ les and cause a heart attack by blocking the blood pressure .
and par@@ al@@ y@@ sis is par@@ al@@ y@@ sed in the blo@@ od@@ shed and is par@@ al@@ y@@ sed in the event it sp@@ il@@ ls out of the do@@ g .
the risk of a crisis by those who had already spent a crisis is higher .
established by the united kingdom trade firm as@@ tra@@ z@@ en@@ ec@@ a , the united kingdom is de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing the risk , reducing the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of its e@@ dge .
today &apos;s nice man@@ u@@ al proposes that the men be given 90 m@@ g ti@@ c@@ ag@@ re@@ l@@ or for 12 months , and , later , two years on a day , along with as@@ pir@@ ing .
&quot; although effective secondary medicine prevention tre@@ at@@ ments exist , about a quarter of those who had heart attacks are undergoing another heart attack or par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , and the results are often devastating , &quot; said professor car@@ ole lon@@ g@@ son , an ad@@ min@@ ist@@ rat@@ or at the nice health technology evaluation centre .
the fear of re@@ cor@@ ding can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of one .
del@@ il@@ ler shows that using ti@@ c@@ ag@@ re@@ l@@ u along with as@@ pir@@ in , with heart attack and par@@ al@@ y@@ sis reduction in the risk of par@@ al@@ y@@ sing in those who had previously suffered a heart attack .
with ti@@ car temporarily proposed , we are pleased to increase cu@@ sto@@ m options for tre@@ ating thousands of people waiting to take advantage of it .
the man@@ u@@ al does not recommend any treatment after that period , since information that has passed through three years -- specifically , the risk of blood fe@@ u@@ ds -- is limited .
p@@ c culture ra@@ ti@@ fies voter fraud in muslim areas
former to@@ w@@ er movement president l@@ ut@@ fu@@ r ra@@ h@@ man was dismissed from his post after a government report last year .
as the de@@ struc@@ tive government report now shows , the culture of political ac@@ cur@@ acy has led to widespread de@@ spa@@ ir among muslim communities .
former cabinet minister er@@ ic pic@@ k@@ les dismissed election observers and the municipal palace of municipal authorities for abuse of power due to &quot; extreme sen@@ si@@ ti@@ v@@ ity on ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former community secretary and today &apos;s anti @-@ corruption ci@@ r@@ c@@ le is so ap@@ pe@@ aling for voters to be in@@ ti@@ mi@@ dated on religious grounds , and it is necessary to allow police to ex@@ c@@ lu@@ de voter turnout to protect cor@@ ners .
voters suggested they have their i@@ den@@ ti@@ ties with each other to prove their identity at a time of voting .
and as things stand now , it &apos;s enough for the electorate to speak the name and address .
the report even suggested that a permanent crew be set up during the vote to prevent individuals from voting twice .
those found in a tip should be better preserved , he said .
he called for better access to the press to determine the documents and the decisions of non @-@ formal committees or working groups .
&quot; it is not only intended to provide protection against fraud in the elections , but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud , which has been addressing it , &quot; he said .
the report was prepared under the orders of to@@ w@@ er movement t@@ s following london &apos;s vote scandal .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that mayor l@@ ut@@ fu@@ r ra@@ h@@ man would be removed from his post , following repeated corruption and illegal practices .
ra@@ h@@ man found that the muslim community &quot; mis@@ used &quot; its religious fe@@ el@@ ings and mis@@ used him with accusations of rac@@ ism and is@@ lam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia , the court said .
ra@@ h@@ man was quoted as saying that &quot; the participation of be@@ li@@ ef@@ s in his campaign was based on the basis that it was a religious duty . &quot;
the play up to 300 years ago was suspicious , and was the result of the consequences of using false id cards , i@@ .@@ e@@ . , voting as o@@ be@@ yed .
there was evidence of fraud conducted throughout the country , said er@@ ic .
in particular , he warned of corruption in vote @-@ rig@@ ging -- that the muslim community pres@@ sured older individuals to vote for the island they chose .
er@@ ic has made some proposals for the organisation of the voting system , including having an identity card to prove who individuals are .
&quot; there has been evidence of pressure on some ethnic minority communities to vote in compliance with the will of the elderly in their communities of p@@ ak@@ ist@@ an@@ i and ban@@ g@@ la@@ des@@ h , especially among women and youth .
&quot; there have been concerns that state institutions ignore such behaviour because of the &quot; political ac@@ cur@@ acy &quot; of ethnicity and religion . &quot;
he suggested 50 proposals for the organisation of the system , including the ob@@ st@@ ru@@ ction of the post and voting papers from political activists in order to prevent them from processing &quot; for votes . &quot;
the report , conducted by ther@@ es@@ a may , also called for ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing registration checks to prevent the use of electoral mass immigration and welfare corruption .
the choice for voter &apos;s id card before voting is considered a requirement .
in the wake of the vote to prevent one person from voting twice , the employment of the person is permanent .
systematic checks on the nationality of an individual are conducted to determine eli@@ gi@@ bility .
a three @-@ year restri@@ ction of demands for an auto@@ ma@@ ted vote was imposed on auto@@ ma@@ tes .

it is essential that only english talk , except those in the voting cab@@ s ( in the same time ) .
re@@ infor@@ cing training is that the staff receives for voter isolation as a result of the rule .
b@@ r er@@ ic criticised the police force for being bru@@ tal@@ ly critical , saying it was &quot; interesting &quot; for failing to indi@@ ct any charges in the to@@ w@@ er movement .
&quot; the electoral court ruled that charges for l@@ ut@@ fu@@ r ra@@ h@@ man and his representative were not exist on charges of corruption and illegal activities , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty on a series of grounds , beyond reasonable s@@ us@@ p@@ ici@@ ons -- in the qu@@ ali@@ fication of the criminal evidence .
he also criticised municipal authorities for their &quot; cheap signal &quot; in the electoral registration department of the municipality .
&quot; to@@ w@@ er movement was an al@@ ar@@ m alert to last year &apos;s court decision .
although our nation has the ur@@ gency to form the me@@ m@@ or@@ ies of our parliaments , it may be a cause for the spread of an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y and hidden electoral fraud and the rejection by some institutions that would undermine that good reputation .

sp@@ ik@@ er by@@ r@@ on ma@@ c@@ donald thought the mic@@ ro@@ phone was closed as women began to announce their own ideas in the 4@@ x@@ i@@ ii free flag @-@ be@@ ar@@ er competition .
he was included in c@@ bc &apos;s statement to qu@@ ic@@ k the sp@@ ik@@ er team : the tin@@ y chinese heavy cla@@ y , 14 @-@ year @-@ old and i ba@@ by .
he was over@@ ly ex@@ cited , like a bad s@@ me@@ ar , and died like a p@@ ig@@ s .
for that , they are comp@@ la@@ ining .
chinese sw@@ im@@ mer a@@ i yan@@ han ( 14 ) finished the second le@@ g of the flag competition for 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 , allowing canadian t@@ ay@@ l@@ or ra@@ ck to close the gap between the can@@ ons and china .
canadian viewers act fast , den@@ oun@@ cing ton@@ es , can@@ ton and language
&quot; has the c@@ bc specu@@ lated that his 14 @-@ year @-@ old man died like a pi@@ g ?
&quot; we were not aware that he was still spread .

in t@@ w@@ it@@ ter , t@@ w@@ it@@ ter has faced criticism about b@@ y@@ ron ma@@ c@@ ma@@ c@@ le@@ s , with many calling him a tip @-@ off .
t@@ w@@ it@@ ter users dis@@ o@@ be@@ yed themselves when they heard about how des@@ per@@ ate b@@ y@@ ron ma@@ c@@ donald acted .
in another t@@ w@@ it@@ ter , sar@@ ah par@@ a@@ di@@ s , is written by t@@ w@@ it@@ ter .
&quot; if you are representing c@@ bc and canada , and it is something that all of us are seen as rac@@ ism .
soon after , s@@ c@@ bc pu@@ b@@ lis@@ her s@@ c@@ ot@@ t rus@@ sel filed an ap@@ ology for the interpre@@ tation of ma@@ c@@ donald : &apos; we apolog@@ ise for the comment on the swimming race &apos; .
they were really not elected words , we were sor@@ ry for such an incident .
the c@@ bc had at least 90 more ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ es from t@@ we@@ et@@ ers in response to the interpre@@ tation .
s@@ c@@ ot@@ t rus@@ sel , another sp@@ ik@@ e , had to study the name of ma@@ c@@ donald
the c@@ bc later re@@ bu@@ ff@@ ed and conducted the ap@@ ology of over 90 t@@ w@@ it@@ ter users who had reported their complaint about donald &apos;s comments .
the network issued a statement with quick ap@@ ology .
we want to express our s@@ inc@@ er@@ ity that this statement has been given , and that it is based on their publication .
in the evening , we were quick to apolog@@ ise to our viewers and our social media as well .
the statement was related to the performance of by@@ rin@@ th@@ ine &apos;s comments , and not to the person@@ ality of her cli@@ ent .
in addition , they were not elected in@@ ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ately and un@@ for@@ tun@@ ately , and by@@ r@@ on was very sad about what he said .
on thursday afternoon , ma@@ c@@ ist ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ es ap@@ olo@@ gi@@ es issued an ap@@ ology in the book , saying they did not want to do so in a personal attack .
i want an ap@@ ology on c@@ bc &apos;s olympic air to comment that i did after the women &apos;s ban@@ ner competition for the evening , &quot; she said .
i was referring to his performance , and not to his son &apos;s age .
he doesn &apos;t need to say too much , i don &apos;t want to respect it , and i am so sor@@ ry . &quot;
the pri@@ mark cu@@ sto@@ m was a fur@@ y against a woman who tried a s@@ c@@ ary internal w@@ r@@ ist in the middle of the store .
customers could not know what they will do when a woman ap@@ po@@ in@@ ts her c@@ lo@@ ck to try a restaurant in the middle of pri@@ mark .
even worse , she looked at and re@@ pa@@ i@@ red how it seemed to happen in her field .
he continued to look at , and later tried four pa@@ in@@ ting inter@@ i@@ ors at the bou@@ ver@@ ie pla@@ ce shopping m@@ all in ra@@ dan .
she was the pri@@ mark store at the bou@@ ver@@ ie pla@@ ce shopping m@@ all in fo@@ g@@ gy in the out@@ let of fo@@ ot before re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ing the woman was pic@@ ked up .
j@@ en@@ ny da@@ vi@@ d@@ son , a mother of two young children in the department at the store , said that the my@@ ster@@ ious woman went on to re@@ cor@@ ding his interior m@@ ou@@ th after re@@ f@@ res@@ h@@ ing and he got out of store without anything .
&quot; people didn &apos;t believe in their eyes .
he stopped in the middle of the store and made a cop@@ y of his shop , pul@@ ling his cultural sou@@ l and pan@@ tol@@ a , and we@@ i@@ gh@@ ed on it .
&quot; they didn &apos;t try to find a special place to do so , but they stopped with all due respect .
when she pul@@ led a s@@ cul@@ p@@ ture , all looked at it and was evident she didn &apos;t like a cul@@ pri@@ t because it was back on the shel@@ f again .
until they decided that he didn &apos;t like anything , he tried three more co@@ ats and then moved out of the store .
&quot; it looked like those who followed it did not seem like they would like to care , and they did not think of the her@@ o@@ es he was then buying . &quot;
&quot; the more she we@@ ars it , how much to think that so@@ me@@ body will get a he@@ c@@ tar@@ e of one cul@@ t or another , and he will go to the house , &quot; said the woman &apos;s da@@ vi@@ d@@ son ( 33 ) , a resident of the town .
the incident took place on tuesday afternoon .
the woman &apos;s da@@ vi@@ d@@ son added : after that , i think she got the staff out of selling the d@@ res@@ ses in her way , which is good .
when i got a new cul@@ t and went home , it was really bad to me to think if he we@@ ars someone else and that he was in no way stu@@ ff@@ ed , &quot; he said .
a ba@@ by spokesman : &apos; pri@@ mark &apos; was the news of the incident at our department in fol@@ ke@@ stone on tuesday ( august 9th ) .
their related product has been removed from the sale .
how you can defend yo@@ ur@@ self against armed attacks
such a video offered by da@@ il@@ y@@ ma@@ il@@ y@@ ma@@ il@@ .com could help you become more tr@@ us@@ ted .
we have met with chief mas@@ ter r@@ h@@ on mi@@ z@@ ra@@ ch@@ i in the new york @-@ based kra@@ v ma@@ ga federation to know how to deal with armed rob@@ ber@@ s in the close distance .
this video , for example , will tell you , how to turn the situation into the op@@ pos@@ ite of the rob@@ ber@@ y .
mi@@ z@@ ra@@ ch@@ i says that when your back to your back home , your first thing was to return to the face , to see the attac@@ ker and say &apos; well under fire &apos; .
you will then hit the face of your vac@@ u@@ um by covering the gun between your preliminary and o@@ m@@ bu@@ d@@ s@@ person .
then when you th@@ row them down , the fire will take on the fire , turning it in the back and back in the back , but the gun and weapons will remain in the back and forth , in the back , the de@@ tac@@ h@@ ment of him will remain in the back .
when the gun person ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed , a similar te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que will be ex@@ er@@ c@@ ised , by fir@@ ing your body from the water@@ falls , and in the way that the gun and the attac@@ ker cannot fire .
at the same time , you are doing so by er@@ as@@ ing your weight , pro@@ f@@ iting from the anti @-@ terrorist region in the ch@@ est region in ghana , th@@ er@@ e@@ by turning it into weapons and th@@ ri@@ ving it .
is an al@@ l@@ ot@@ tery ?
to see how mi@@ ra@@ ch@@ i did it , the video is passed to see how she does so .
but when you are not a kra@@ v ma@@ ga s@@ pre@@ e , if you are the one who would take the sa@@ f@@ est way to avoid every genocide , it would be to pe@@ t your money .
ge@@ or@@ gi@@ an wright takes his wish for travel guide to europe &apos;s most pic@@ k@@ up
in a serious test , he had put out a im@@ mun@@ e system and ac@@ credi@@ tation by in@@ sti@@ t@@ ut@@ ing some of the most p@@ is and ne@@ e@@ d@@ les in europe .
ser@@ vers and ge@@ or@@ gi@@ ans , ian wright ( 51 ) , issued a euro ban@@ k@@ note to prove the power of the im@@ mun@@ e system , a pic@@ k@@ up ci@@ r@@ cus , a train g@@ ri@@ d si@@ g@@ nature and a ba@@ by phone call in russia .
before in@@ fur@@ i@@ ating every objec@@ t , he and we used a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e to demonstrate what kind of work is connected to him and us .
however , the ex@@ per@@ im@@ en@@ tal results came some surprising results , which will be transformed into a movie by the li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker to in@@ ner st@@ ren@@ g@@ th .
although it is deeply b@@ lin@@ d to keep a fund in a trend used by thousands of people , there is a much worse view of the cu@@ is@@ ine la@@ v@@ ab@@ les in fact .
during his tour in europe , mr. wright wright wright met with doctors and medical experts in connection with the increase and health .
for@@ tun@@ ately , there has been no dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cies in what he left on his m@@ ou@@ th .
mr. wright wright wright wright wright wright wright was known for visiting the world and testing its le@@ g &apos;s res@@ ili@@ ence by la@@ g@@ ging and cra@@ cking down .
that st@@ um@@ bling on , ranging from the p@@ har@@ ma@@ cies at the railway stations to the we@@ d@@ dings of the to@@ il@@ et si@@ mu@@ la@@ tor , tested the im@@ mun@@ e system .
in the movie about that , he said that i have not been a child since i was ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood , and i have put many things in ag@@ on@@ y as far as the soil , the left and the mu@@ d .
during the film , he finally proved his mo@@ tive .
the only thing he refused was a p@@ is re@@ tr@@ um@@ pe@@ t in russia .
more than 4,000 units conducted a su@@ c@@ ces@@ sion .
by comparison , the number of these new de@@ par@@ t@@ ments must be lower than 60 .
however , the newly de@@ ple@@ ted hands included a n@@ um@@ a me@@ tr@@ e , which was less than 60 and was refused to lie when the census was higher than 4,000 sub@@ mer@@ ged .
mr. wright wright wright wright wright wright wright wright and finnish milk products producer v@@ ali@@ o claimed the tra@@ der &apos;s gu@@ de to in@@ ner st@@ ren@@ g@@ th , which shows the number of cop@@ ies in different locations like ban@@ y@@ o .
he said he went to the movie : &apos; it &apos;s close to being one of the worst things i had co@@ ded with in a to@@ il@@ et .
there can be no more thing than that !
i will not lie anything because i are dis@@ g@@ us@@ ted .
the li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker was prepared together with the finnish producer of milk products , v@@ ali@@ o .
it provided m@@ r wright wright wright wright wright wright wright with v@@ ali@@ o ge@@ fil@@ us , which helped strengthen the la@@ x as@@ se@@ mb@@ lies and im@@ mun@@ e system , as well as the c and d vit@@ am@@ in@@ es .
v@@ ali@@ o &apos;s re@@ ci@@ p@@ es , fru@@ its and new categories of ca@@ te@@ gor@@ ised president ni@@ ko vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a said : &quot; we wanted to give consumers something really new .
i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ ying is something that is impressive , and that at the same time , it will announce the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
in the end , we had many s@@ cat@@ tered c@@ er@@ e@@ als that had come up with the idea of &quot; let &apos;s look back . &quot;
mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ation in mine health claims it has become a global phenomenon
instead of simply talking about products , we wanted to give our products a much bigger context ; daily , good and bad bac@@ ter@@ ia in our environment is linked to the importance of the mi@@ x@@ ture and its im@@ mun@@ e system .
interest in the wel@@ l@@ being is becoming a global phenomenon , and we have told consumers that in this case , we can offer much more information .
at the same time , i think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of h@@ um@@ our !
&quot; i can say that i have lost my respect to some things that i wanted to lie like the ne@@ p@@ he@@ w russian to@@ il@@ ets shown in the movie , &quot; said to@@ m h@@ ak@@ al@@ a , who directed the film .
nat@@ ur@@ ally , some were easy to in@@ du@@ ce some things , but some were very difficult .
i am happy that we got some of these di@@ al@@ ec@@ t li@@ g@@ n@@ ite actions .
in a survey conducted in 2015 by v@@ ali@@ o , 84 per cent of respondents associated their k@@ la@@ k@@ tic as@@ it cop@@ ies with a mi@@ x@@ ture of good health , and 58 per cent said they used their products as ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary , with la@@ bor@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
ma@@ gan@@ da family destroyed in s@@ alt@@ te , cor@@ n@@ than social housing , prior to release
in one ma@@ gan@@ da family was damaged by 5@@ 50,000 items in a social housing , where they were evacu@@ ated for their neighbours .
following several complaints from tan@@ ya s@@ ke@@ l@@ don and his wife , sha@@ un tre@@ bil@@ co@@ ck , s@@ alt@@ ash was taken out of a residential building in cor@@ n@@ wall .
when it was for@@ ci@@ bly removed , housing association officials were shocked by the fact that the property was un@@ re@@ pa@@ i@@ red .
large dra@@ w@@ ings were on the walls , gra@@ ff@@ iti were dum@@ ped , sites dum@@ ped and written gra@@ ff@@ iti on the walls .
family now out of housing , pur@@ por@@ te@@ d@@ ly taken to take advantage of private accommodation options
cor@@ n@@ wall ho@@ us@@ ing director don@@ na m@@ ce@@ v@@ y said he was afraid the situation would be sal@@ va@@ ged .
&quot; this is really a night@@ m@@ are for people here , and i think that people should not have to live in this way .
there is a lot to be taken into account , as this property is now known as a very non @-@ pleas@@ ant part of cor@@ n@@ wall .
this family pos@@ se@@ ss a bad fa@@ me and their names have a poor reputation .
the family had three da@@ i@@ ries living oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally , and according to police , the family used a sle@@ ig@@ h in the street to fight the bas@@ e@@ ball with bas@@ e@@ ball pa@@ in@@ ting , ter@@ r@@ or@@ ising nearby residents , selling drugs , and ex@@ ces@@ sing ex@@ cep@@ tional be@@ ha@@ vi@@ o@@ ur@@ al be@@ ha@@ vi@@ o@@ ur@@ al be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or , and e@@ ing f@@ ak@@ e be@@ ha@@ vi@@ o@@ ur@@ al be@@ ha@@ vi@@ o@@ ur@@ al be@@ ha@@ vi@@ o@@ ur@@ al .
in june , an anti @-@ social decision was made for s@@ ke@@ l@@ don ( 47 ) , whose name is known in the contract for rent .
old land@@ fil@@ ls found in house where de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion is believed to have been de@@ m@@ ol@@ ished
drug @-@ fu@@ el@@ led property de@@ te@@ c@@ ted in the past
neighbours say they see war on the streets and that police are often searching
cor@@ n@@ wall ho@@ us@@ ing forced him and his wife to leave the property this week after 11 weeks of pr@@ ol@@ on@@ ged to transport voluntarily .
the evacu@@ ation was greeted with relief by neighbours who said their life was turning back to m@@ ile .
one person said : &apos; no one did they care &apos; .
we have been with them for 20 years and the situation was always bad .
when we tell you that once we see police here , you can &apos;t believe .
&quot; we didn &apos;t sle@@ ep this morning .
we were on the alert because the average was too qu@@ i@@ et ; we didn &apos;t get used to it !
finally , things will be great .
ada@@ m f@@ it@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , a ne@@ c@@ tor of cor@@ n@@ wall ho@@ us@@ ing , said the family is not co @-@ operating with the local government .
for 20 years , family lived in that house , and my m@@ ou@@ th was often urged by police
fo@@ ur@@ teen times as a social housing was covered , w@@ rec@@ k@@ age gar@@ ba@@ ge and old to@@ ys on its side
th@@ a@@ i added : it is really sha@@ me@@ ful that the &apos; ten@@ ant &apos; does not take any responsibility regarding the release of his or her family ; for ev@@ ic@@ tion , it was always the option that cor@@ n@@ wall ho@@ us@@ ing has finally ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed .
it was very difficult , since behaviour was too extreme and its actions were fri@@ ghtened by neighbours , which should not be indi@@ ff@@ er@@ ent .
i ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate the efforts of members of the community who put forward their team , together with dev@@ on and cor@@ n@@ wall police forces , to give us information .
i hope that this development will bring some relief to neighbours and as a message that there will be no tolerance for anti@@ social be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
m@@ r f@@ it@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said they had three s@@ ons living in the property at different times , but they were in their 20@@ s .

police say they will work to evacu@@ ate ten@@ ants who violate pollution rules
angela cro@@ w , a member of the dev@@ on and cor@@ n@@ age police , said the al@@ location is a warning to other ten@@ ants who continue to violate the rules .
he said , &quot; this is a message for the people who can be@@ have as they want without having to face any c@@ lu@@ es and think that their behaviour will be in va@@ in . &quot;
the dev@@ on and cor@@ n@@ wall police forces will never tol@@ er@@ ate crime and anti @-@ social behaviour , as they continue to work with their partners to protect society .

this is what tourists began to pan@@ ic as a low @-@ flying couple sli@@ pped off .
the drama shows a close military plane at the level of contact with s@@ prin@@ k@@ lers in av@@ e@@ ir@@ o , a town in northern portugal .

tourists from the beach in av@@ e@@ ir@@ o hur@@ ri@@ ed to the de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion as the plane pul@@ led through the s@@ mel@@ ter began flying at an extremely low price .
the portuguese air force said that today &apos;s p @-@ 3@@ c or@@ ion aircraft are on an training flight to identify fishing bo@@ ats on the coast , and that it is up to as low as it is the only way to control them .
because the s@@ lu@@ g@@ g@@ ish s@@ lu@@ g@@ g@@ ish was see@@ min@@ g@@ ly in@@ tra@@ c@@ table due to a di@@ r@@ e smoke coming from the fire , the aircraft said , the air forces insisted no one was je@@ op@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed by the intention of police .

&quot; we hope this will under@@ line that , for others , it is truly ris@@ k@@ y to go to war regions as a tomb and a te@@ st@@ am@@ ent , and that people will dis@@ courage in making this choice . &quot;
two girls from s@@ ul@@ tan@@ a and east london were flo@@ wn to turkey in february 2015 , where they bo@@ ar@@ ded a plane and then to the syrian border .
s@@ ul@@ tan@@ a &apos;s family was told to be married with a fire fi@@ gh@@ ter in syria and to sta@@ ve off in months .
re@@ id says she will not give up gar@@ land as top court candidate if clinton elec@@ ts
har@@ ry re@@ id , leader of the senate democrats , said he believed the democrats would nomin@@ ate judge mer@@ ri@@ ck gar@@ land for the supreme court in the election of a presidential candidate , hillary clinton .
the republican republics in the senate have been blocking the ver@@ i@@ fication process since president barack obama named him as his choice in march .
the majority leader of the senate , mit@@ ch mc@@ con@@ ne@@ l@@ l , said he would choose a new president to replace former supreme court judge an@@ ton@@ in s@@ cal@@ ia .
clinton believes in the choice of gar@@ land will pick gar@@ land , and &quot; we have reasons for this , &quot; re@@ id said in an apparent speech thursday .
a spokesman for re@@ id later said he had spoken directly with clinton about whether he would nomin@@ ate gar@@ land .
he praised gar@@ land and said clinton &apos;s team did not want to &quot; s@@ po@@ il the current situation &quot; by making a new choice .
gar@@ land is the presiding judge at the us court of appeal in col@@ um@@ bia , col@@ um@@ bia .
re@@ id said that he@@ p was the &quot; injured ben@@ ef@@ ici@@ aries &quot; and &quot; burns &quot; of re@@ pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ist donald tr@@ um@@ p .
tr@@ um@@ p has said it is not eligible for the post .
tre@@ ats said that for women as much as they are for men , they also favour a &apos; pla@@ que cal@@ en@@ dar cal@@ en@@ dar &apos; .
the magazine tre@@ ats is working with photo@@ grap@@ her david bel@@ le@@ m@@ er@@ e to identify with the photo@@ grap@@ her who was preparing and prepared for 20@@ 17 from pi@@ re@@ l@@ li in the 19@@ 7@@ 0s .
however , instead of well @-@ known and ci@@ r@@ cus people , the new generation of te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers is working to find top models for the cal@@ en@@ dar .
ste@@ ve sha@@ w , president of tre@@ ats , said earlier this year that the magazine is different from the old p@@ lay@@ bo@@ y , which was high pre@@ fer@@ red earlier this year , because &quot; the play@@ ground is for the men . &quot;
i do this for women .
clearly , he believes that the timetable is like that .
&quot; we need , like men , to return to the cl@@ as@@ sic license plates that do not s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted to look at the images of the women &apos;s body as a source of com@@ for@@ t in this regard , &quot; sha@@ w said in a press release on the cal@@ en@@ dar .
because of its beautiful art , women will want to be part of this project .
models can send photos or participate in open discussions in los an@@ ge@@ le@@ s and new york .
vin@@ il target : who is in reality ?
the middle ages are simply be@@ si@@ e@@ ged by men &apos;s vin@@ es .
let us tell us that this statement was based on the actual data of the body before they went to the police department to ins@@ ul@@ t them with so many times that they do not like that , but rather to make sure they could do so .
according to y@@ ou@@ go@@ v , it is not a result of the s@@ us@@ pen@@ se that the pla@@ te created by the pla@@ cement of plates that are a subject of far @-@ reaching topics : the return of the plates , which is a physical objec@@ t , is the result of n@@ os@@ tal@@ g@@ ia in the middle ages .
recently , the v@@ ir@@ tu@@ e al@@ bu@@ m purchase is mostly between 45 and 54 .
based on his su@@ bor@@ din@@ ate , the 18 @-@ 24 @-@ year @-@ old group is the lowest .
it is not only caused by the ac@@ cum@@ u@@ la@@ ting of the mar@@ ty@@ rs &apos; action ; it is emo@@ tionally important ; it is usually old cr@@ it@@ er@@ ion buyers who like to hide their sen@@ ti@@ ments ( 56 % and 53 % ) and is ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary ( 69 % and 66 % ) .
but are y@@ ou@@ go@@ v &apos;s results true ?
if this blo@@ g had been a news on the tv set , the camer@@ a so@@ h@@ o was wal@@ king on a crowded street in a hand@@ ful of grey team g@@ lov@@ es , while many j@@ es@@ us first and his hands were making many j@@ es@@ us exhibitions and , and then , i can say , &quot; let &apos;s just think , &quot; let &apos;s say . &quot; let &apos;s time , &quot;
then , let &apos;s think about it .
so@@ h@@ o &apos;s centre is slowly losing its mag@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de and ex@@ c@@ lu@@ de ( the buildings , once in@@ de@@ pen@@ dents with an independent ven@@ dors ) , and still have a few speci@@ al@@ ties with hotels , e@@ ats , pre@@ ts , pre@@ ts and pap@@ er@@ gates .
i would probably prefer to stop the camer@@ a for the next part ; i would have tried to learn about their age and emo@@ tional status through monitoring by si@@ mu@@ lating some of these stores by standing near some of the different men .
s@@ or ray : two young women , three middle @-@ aged women , go to rec@@ k@@ les@@ s re@@ cor@@ ds ( the data count , eight middle @-@ aged men ) , and i as a woman in 20 years after a meeting in london ( 55 ) , where he sp@@ ends a few hours and a few hours in an early afternoon for a meeting .
i ask for a colle@@ c@@ tor .
&quot; i think so , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these pla@@ t@@ forms , which were formally located on the ground ( it sent me with e @-@ mail ) , de@@ cor@@ ates the walls of the room for sitting in bosnia and herzegovina ( stu@@ ff@@ ing it until her home ) .
it is partly due to the fact that it re@@ ap@@ ed so many al@@ b@@ ums and syn@@ di@@ ca@@ tes -- in part , when it is first available -- that it can buy the plates that it can afford to buy back in time for the young , me@@ te@@ or@@ ic times .
&quot; most of what i get was 70 b@@ um@@ ps with the end of the 6@@ 0s , when i was 11 or 12 years old , i am very young to get , &quot; she said .
the pla@@ k bu@@ ys agree that it is likely to stay alone ; there are people who are f@@ lo@@ w@@ ing to drink , who are f@@ lo@@ o@@ ded . &quot; smoking , i don &apos;t get a good blood alcohol , &quot; he said .
that is my bad cause .
we@@ z , who works for s@@ or ray ( 25 ) , also thinks most of the customers he en@@ counter@@ ed are comp@@ lying with the y@@ ou@@ go@@ v profile .
he realised , however , that a new wave of events affected by the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated media is created , while people who feel that the mo@@ b has been restored , need to rec@@ over old plates .
during my talks , i normal@@ ly realised that people in 1998 or 1999 have an overhaul of their colle@@ ctions .
customers who first sold their cr@@ an@@ es to buy c@@ ds are now selling c@@ ds to buy their pla@@ t@@ forms . &quot;
this can explain the growth of a particular person who re@@ vi@@ ves vin@@ i .
but what &apos;s the emo@@ tional significance of the either pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff@@ s ?
a few seconds , it takes you to realise that pl@@ as@@ ter stores can offer a f@@ la@@ w@@ ed community of similar person@@ alities in a store like ph@@ on@@ y , like ph@@ on@@ ica .
according to we@@ z , some older @-@ year @-@ old big customers had gone to the system of non @-@ contact pay .
some cr@@ an@@ es can seek re@@ fu@@ ge at the stability of sha@@ dy pla@@ que tra@@ cks , which have become a remin@@ der of their re@@ se@@ mb@@ lan@@ ce and re@@ tr@@ os@@ pec@@ tive youth me@@ m@@ or@@ ies from around the world .
&quot; sometimes it is a reason to fill in a vac@@ u@@ um or see the material as a sort of com@@ for@@ t , &quot; said we@@ z .
i was a colle@@ c@@ tor for myself , and that &apos;s what i think is also a lot of people .
it &apos;s an easy way to fill your c@@ af@@ é .
&quot; we are like social workers , &quot; said a colle@@ ag@@ u@@ e who was j@@ um@@ ping out of a pla@@ que .
a poll conducted in april revealed that 50 % of the vin@@ y@@ d al@@ bu@@ m has not yet heard about al@@ b@@ ums .
at the same time , the survey found that 41 % had a pic@@ k@@ up and 7 % bought the vin@@ es , although they had never used it .
in that phase of news , i was very concerned about when they focused on a series of bos@@ n@@ a nova accounts , probably on a series of bos@@ ses .
that is a &quot; reward &quot; for return . ( data census : three middle @-@ aged e@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ ans ) re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ zed by j@@ on@@ ny ( 42 ) .
&quot; one recent came to me , and he said , &quot; i have no pla@@ t@@ forms but want to take a radi@@ o@@ he@@ ad pla@@ t@@ forms to carry out our shel@@ f . &quot;
though this does not represent a large percentage , it reflects the current situation .
more products are products , fewer music .
&quot; i have no pla@@ ks . &quot;
they are not the elderly , but the young , who are after their decades of age , entering that subject .
when i came to the f@@ op@@ p , which has almost once allocated almost all for vin@@ il , i see the w@@ it@@ ch as being very different .
there are co@@ up@@ les , photo@@ graph@@ ers , young boys and middle @-@ aged women among the ages of 70 .
it is good to see a variety of di@@ ver@@ si@@ fication among customers , although less d@@ ing@@ ing of stores ( last part of wild be@@ as@@ t ) along with h@@ ing@@ in and hop@@ ar@@ ad@@ ar@@ ds from h@@ op@@ ar@@ ists are con@@ t@@ acted by sex @-@ based pop j@@ it@@ ters instead of pe@@ p@@ per jazz .
none of them can be particularly alone , but more than 30 seconds , creating psychological tra@@ um@@ a that dist@@ ur@@ bed them .
the e@@ lan@@ ora ( 27 ) is travelling in the f@@ op@@ p for a few minutes and look at the reduced plates .
instead of spending , he has come to look only on the windows .
he says he has no choice to make a beach collection because he has not gained much .
it &apos;s very expensive .
it &apos;s easier to listen to music in computers or other forms , but the beauty of the cr@@ an@@ e is ... just like someone lov@@ es them .
i don &apos;t know how to explain i would be , in fact , without any illu@@ sions .
the last round is a post : ur@@ ban out@@ f@@ it@@ ters , said to have in@@ sp@@ i@@ red new generation of cr@@ an@@ es .
when ko@@ t pan@@ tol@@ a seemed to re@@ vis@@ e them , i observe a group of young girls who gathered around the pol@@ e in pol@@ ar@@ o@@ id cameras , prior to a debate over a father and daughter buying a cr@@ os@@ s .
with the left , j@@ ef@@ f bu@@ c@@ k@@ ley has a full mer@@ cy with its plates , am@@ y win@@ e@@ house and fle@@ et@@ wood ma@@ c ; it is a fi@@ x@@ ture of an average collection ; it is a mi@@ x@@ ture of modern and ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood .
no one is be@@ li@@ e@@ ver@@ s ; maybe because these are only a de@@ cor@@ ation , some of them are un@@ tou@@ cha@@ ble .
this is a completely &quot; artistic cr@@ it@@ er@@ ion . &quot;
the wonder about these items , however , may mean that the sector can earn more money and send less customers to so@@ h@@ o &apos;s de@@ p@@ ths ; there is not much to be a cause for complaints .
not sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ingly , it is not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time has spent more luxury items like vin@@ il .
however , my findings suggest that y@@ ou@@ go@@ v &apos;s results are at least correct in so@@ h@@ o pla@@ k stores ; in the fact , they don &apos;t take into account the li@@ me@@ li@@ gh@@ t , female colle@@ c@@ tors or cr@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ists , who have been at least present , on the platform stores or at environmental forums .
they work hard in either school or at the offices .
they certainly travel the evenings in the beach stores on ber@@ w@@ ic@@ k street , re@@ viewing their plates and fle@@ e@@ ing through a 30 @-@ year @-@ old f@@ ak@@ e tv ser@@ ver for the middle @-@ aged men &apos;s sho@@ ul@@ ders , who have no knowledge of anything .

french court rejects offer to de@@ m@@ ol@@ ish shops at jun@@ g@@ le refugee camp
a court in france rejected a proposal by cal@@ a@@ da authorities to de@@ m@@ ol@@ ish scores of ma@@ ke@@ shift shops and restaurants at the jun@@ g@@ le camp , where thousands of refugees lived .
during this week &apos;s trial hearing , cal@@ a@@ is officials argued that the state should de@@ m@@ ol@@ ish a total of 72 ma@@ ke@@ over stores , where c@@ amp@@ a@@ ig@@ ned people from the camp sold as much products as they can buy from cigarettes or 50 cen@@ ts ( 4@@ 0@@ p ) , or sold from basic dis@@ hes for a few euros .
cal@@ a@@ is val@@ u@@ ed the need to de@@ m@@ ol@@ ish these locations because they create a parallel economy for not paying taxes and because they hold risk regarding fires and hy@@ gi@@ ene .
the ben@@ ef@@ ici@@ ary groups said that shops and restaurants in the court are vital , and that it is not enough for the increasing population of the camp that the state @-@ sponsored organisations and other groups offer .
ma@@ ke@@ shift stores and restaurants argued that they often provide shelter and free food to their needed owners .
a court in l@@ il@@ le said there was no legal an@@ ch@@ or for the de@@ por@@ tation of 72 ma@@ ke@@ shift stores , but the concerns of cal@@ a@@ ba@@ g@@ is governor were &quot; totally under@@ stan@@ dable . &quot;
presiding judge jean @-@ fran@@ co@@ is mol@@ la said the he@@ i@@ ghts , si@@ gh@@ t@@ seeing , cafes and restaurants had taken a much bigger role , than just those of people living in &quot; very dangerous conditions . &quot;
these areas have been provided with comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers , she said .
for children with no profit @-@ purpose , a living in danger of de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion , jun@@ g@@ le is offering 200 goods a din@@ ner every day , it provides english and french courses , and there are ad@@ vis@@ ers for hundreds of des@@ per@@ ate refugees in the camp .
over 17@@ 0,000 people signed a petition to protect the child &apos;s delegation .
this closure will &quot; be a f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ator for these children , some of whom are eight years old , &quot; the guardian said in a letter .
two charity institutions , hel@@ p re@@ fu@@ ges and l &apos;@@ au@@ ber@@ ge des mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts , had estimated friday that the population at the jun@@ g@@ le camp , after rising levels during the summer , would be above 9,000 ( the highest peak to date ) .
following gold in the fi@@ g@@ time d d d , britain took the silver medal at ru@@ g@@ by ye@@ language for the tro@@ ph@@ y championship .
the dramatic progress of great britain in the ru@@ g@@ by 7 championship ended in the final thursday with fi@@ j@@ i , after a 43 @-@ 7 defeat at the ri@@ o de@@ od@@ or@@ o stadium .
fi@@ j@@ i gave the char@@ t to receive the gold medal -- the first @-@ ever olympic me@@ dal@@ ist in all colo@@ urs -- p@@ as , side action , support , col@@ our lines and k@@ as .
following the defeat , britain took the third silver medal of the day as a non @-@ com@@ for@@ t , and may now be proud of their efforts at the olympic 7 @-@ day opening tournament , which they defeated new ze@@ al@@ and , argentina and south africa .
earlier in the day , the south african team , which they beat in the semi@@ finals , may have found them in the final after losing 7 @-@ 5 .
however , a fi@@ x@@ ture of fi@@ x@@ ture , such as that one , might even beat a 15 @-@ member team .
maybe though not very be@@ li@@ e@@ ver@@ s , a great britain might find it so@@ me@@ how thinking it would take a gold medal tomorrow : fi@@ j@@ i &apos;s chief coach , be@@ n r@@ yan , come from w@@ im@@ ble@@ don .
it was a tough journey through the uk .
eight p@@ ath@@ ways ago , they lost every match in the seven @-@ language championship when they worked with r@@ yan .
this time , they lost only one .
this he@@ zi@@ met can be a vi@@ g@@ our , but the progress achieved is really sha@@ ming .
fi@@ j@@ i made a fas@@ cin@@ ating start , with actors gra@@ vit@@ ating on the br@@ it@@ on of great britain &apos;s territory .
it was like running between a series of mobile buses and a number of mobile buses , and world capital champions put the title at the os@@ e@@ a col@@ in@@ is@@ a@@ o building 5 @-@ 0 .
in the fourth minute , fal@@ ry from the right @-@ wing pur@@ su@@ it of the jer@@ ry tu@@ wa@@ i has another number .
the match was 12 @-@ 0 , and the great uk was virtually de@@ tac@@ h@@ ed .
mit@@ ch@@ el@@ l &apos;s great involvement prevented le@@ one nak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a from th@@ ro@@ wing a third of his ri@@ f@@ le , such as the mountain , but it was only to delay the number of fi@@ f@@ ths .
in the seventh minute , j@@ as@@ a ver@@ em@@ al@@ u@@ a made the lead from the right corner , and the great britain fell 17 @-@ 0 .
with just one minute left to finish the first half , nak@@ ar@@ aw@@ a took the re@@ ins in the world and made another number .
va@@ tem@@ o ra@@ v@@ ou@@ vo@@ u then travelled down to the bo@@ un@@ d@@ ary line , cutting out of a number of for@@ mi@@ dable british interven@@ tions .
with that number , sk@@ or rose to 29 @-@ 0 .
the fi@@ j@@ i 7 championship was a team formed to play for the title , while great britain was trying to find the gro@@ un@@ d@@ work yet .
the situation is more or less similar .
the great uk made big changes and closed the fi@@ br@@ e of fi@@ gy , which was a good move for four minutes , compared to the first half , to the scene , when jos@@ u@@ a tu@@ is@@ ova per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly performed his excellent fi@@ gu@@ m .
dan n@@ or@@ t@@ on tried one ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent for the great uk , and s@@ kor@@ u tried to make the lead out of the left corner to make 36 @-@ 7 , but his fans were in the hands of the sin@@ ging , wav@@ ing flags and dan@@ cing south sea islands .
it was hard not to hear about the e@@ vi@@ l approach by fi@@ j@@ i .
ma@@ a v@@ ili@@ a@@ me added the last minute to them on the fi@@ j game , which had no need to de@@ cor@@ ate .
when the hit the ball , the physi@@ cians began celebrations and kept the door for the great br@@ it@@ on to so@@ ak , which was st@@ y@@ mi@@ e@@ ly st@@ ran@@ ded in the back .
earlier in the day , fi@@ j@@ i beat japan 20 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals , confron@@ ting south africa in a for@@ mi@@ dable semi@@ final ; britain took the lead with a single count .
in the first half , he cited south african team members in the south african team , but led by a number of those who made the latter in the second half .
an@@ th@@ on@@ y &apos;s brother mar@@ cus w@@ at@@ son , who took part in the top 15 in britain , secured a victory and silver medal .
he@@ len gl@@ over and he@@ ath@@ er stan@@ ones were in@@ sp@@ i@@ red by coach &apos;s fight against cancer , k@@ no@@ cking at the ro@@ wing event .
there will be no more emo@@ tional gold at these games , which means significant sense .
in the wake of their initial move , 2@@ 20 az@@ ap che@@ es@@ e bre@@ ath@@ s , he@@ len gl@@ over and he@@ a@@ ther stan@@ ning found that they could have become much more me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful to what they under@@ scored in st@@ ac@@ io de la@@ go@@ a .
although the two men who got ro@@ ws in the bo@@ ats had three sh@@ ots on the boat , the voice of their co@@ ach@@ es in the back @-@ to @-@ bo@@ ar@@ ding process -- as women advance to this level in the uk this year -- was echoed by the voice of ro@@ bin wil@@ li@@ am@@ s as they moved to the second gold medal in the women &apos;s pa@@ ir .
their authority was quite clear -- it was their unprecedented , 3@@ 9th gra@@ de@@ dy series of de@@ fi@@ ance com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions .
although we see two won@@ der@@ ful athletes with bre@@ ath@@ ing in the mo@@ de of mo@@ ther@@ land , this outlook does not exactly reflect the quality of the victory .
every ro@@ wing gold medal is behind the law , there is a tab@@ o@@ o with those who are willing to make this difference , and it was not as effective as long as 30 months ago , they did not know whether they would live as long as a cancer diagnos@@ is .
as he put it , they have touched and gone .
i caught and made it through the sur@@ face cancer that could have been inter@@ fer@@ ed with surgery .
if they don &apos;t do so , they go everywhere .
it would be bad .
this slightly changed your vi@@ e@@ w@@ point .
he had been identified in december 2013 .
apart from the season , the three were very good lu@@ c@@ kil@@ y , since they were able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , and in such situations it would be unknown , but in this way , to h@@ es@@ it@@ ate .
for this reason , i would not have been required to pay , so i would have to quickly improve it .
it was an incentive for me .
i was in hospital and i said that a few steps were enough , but i went up in the gar@@ den at 6 , 9 , 15 metres away .
that way it started .
getting a cross is a journey by itself , but it is a bit larger .
in the wake of his victory , he was in wil@@ li@@ am@@ s , who had a tense morning in order to deal with his own concerns .
&quot; i was emo@@ tionally destroyed this week emo@@ tionally , maybe it &apos;s a little bit more than that , but with great value , &quot; said stan@@ ning , who came to afghanistan earlier this week .
it means what it means to me , and it is more important how much work the he@@ len , be@@ n and ro@@ bin , i em@@ p@@ has@@ ise .
i spent three years with he@@ len and ro@@ bin .
i would like to con@@ ve@@ y my greatest mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ation to him , because we were not a roc@@ ket , so i would not have the best coach in the world .
i could not find a better person or a better coach to work .
he@@ len gl@@ over and he@@ ath@@ er stan@@ ning have not lost the race for five years .
the two have met a tough line that cannot reach opponents .
even during the last 500 metres , when new ze@@ al@@ and and the danish teams closed the site , the strength of stan@@ ning and gl@@ over had yet to be ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted .
we missed ourselves .
he@@ len was watching the process , followed by iz@@ le &apos; .
it is really important not to be gone .
we had a good start and did not try to do something inc@@ re@@ di@@ ble .
we didn &apos;t expect the explosion of fire@@ works today , we didn &apos;t expect to win the race , which we got only good ro@@ wing .
the two will hold a year &apos;s break before deciding what to do in the future .
gl@@ over has a we@@ d@@ ding that should join next month ; he and his tv ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ re@@ r , ste@@ ve bac@@ l , are in the sp@@ ot@@ light .
for the time being , he wants to enjoy that .
i did not want to say that this was my last race .
they would have put pressure on too many .
i did not realise that i was an olympic champion in london .
that was a huge number of new@@ com@@ ers , and i was very st@@ res@@ s@@ ful .
it lasted about four minutes .
that is a much better en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m , &quot; he said .

bulgaria announces inflation rate for the first time in eight months .
monthly inflation in bulgaria was at 1 % in june , according to national statistics .
this is the highest value in years -- since june 2012 -- but it was the first appreciation of zero since october , following a positive rate of 0.@@ 2 % last year .
lower than average inflation in the last 12 months ( august 2015 - july 20@@ 16 ) for the c@@ p@@ i , was 0.@@ 8 % , compared to the previous 12 months ( august 2014 - july 2015 ) .
by comparison , the consumer price index in july 2007 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , compared to 1.@@ 0 % .
since the beginning of the year , the inflation rate has been about 0.@@ 2 % -- compar@@ ing july 20@@ 16 to december 2015 -- and the monthly inflation gap between july 20@@ 16 and july 2015 was 0.@@ 2 % .
compared to the previous month , in july 20@@ 16 , the price hike was observed in consumer product groups : food and non @-@ alcohol ( 1.7 % ) , transportation ( 1.@@ 3 % ) , entertainment and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) , restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) , various services and hotels ( 0.@@ 3 % ) .
c@@ lo@@ ck and sho@@ e ( 2.@@ 2 % ) sli@@ pped in fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure , fur@@ n@@ it@@ ure , household equipment and rout@@ ine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) and healthcare ( 0.@@ 1 % ) groups .
the prices of al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic be@@ ver@@ ages and tobacco ma@@ ts , housing , water , electricity , gas and other fuels were also kept at the same level in telecommunications and education groups .

while s@@ n@@ ap@@ c@@ hat said it was inspired by the ex@@ tra@@ di@@ tions for this fleet , some observers say it is ra@@ ci@@ al .
the s@@ n@@ ap@@ c@@ hat allows it to play with ids at an ab@@ sur@@ dity level , changing the reality of around 150m users every day .

for observers with rac@@ ism ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent , however , the body reminded of the vi@@ br@@ ant ster@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es .
others have generally rejected the comparison to the mo@@ ther@@ land .
gra@@ ce s@@ par@@ ap@@ ani , an american art student of ko@@ re@@ an origin and a t@@ we@@ et who wrote about the photos , said the bul@@ let in an e @-@ mail was &quot; the most dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing and dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing statement . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult for the discussion to compar@@ e the notorious asian car@@ ic@@ at@@ ure to side @-@ by @-@ side , &quot; he added .
this shows that the fleet is not only an asian mas@@ k , but also a de@@ gra@@ ding no@@ ise .
the s@@ n@@ ap@@ c@@ hat is not the only company to have s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted cultural mechanisms .
the american culture seems to be at an end@@ less conflict regarding diversity and con@@ f@@ is@@ cation of various fields , from the institutions &apos; meeting room to hol@@ ly@@ wood , and all of them .
and one can see that there is room for greater sen@@ si@@ ti@@ v@@ ity among young people , who have a greater diversity of race than other opponents .
k@@ ati@@ e z@@ hu , 25 , said in an interview thursday that when the sn@@ ap@@ c@@ hat forms a small ban@@ ner for one u@@ ser , &quot; it is much more difficult to realise that kind of moves are not being noticed as before . &quot;
on thursday , woman z@@ hu , a product manager and eng@@ ine@@ er who worked for medi@@ um , decided to cut his account for the sn@@ ap@@ c@@ hat and called for everyone to do so .
in an article and a phone interview for medi@@ um , he said he believes the interethnic conflict reflects the di@@ ver@@ si@@ fication of employment practices in sn@@ ap@@ c@@ hat .
she criticised the company &apos;s leading team of white men , ending her article with a la@@ bel : s@@ ne@@ ak ti@@ s@@ h .
&quot; because there are no different kinds of eth@@ nic@@ ities among their staff , they can make such decisions or make people of different eth@@ nic@@ ities that work there and are people from different eth@@ nic@@ ities , so they don &apos;t feel secure enough or comfortable , &quot; said the woman , who is of chinese origin .
other observers share his view about the complaint that the sn@@ ap@@ c@@ hat left largely un@@ an@@ s@@ w@@ ered .
the company does not share the figures on di@@ ver@@ si@@ fication among its personnel , hi@@ gh@@ ligh@@ ting the state of private company .
on thursday , he refused to share the ra@@ ci@@ al or@@ ig@@ ins of the sn@@ ap@@ t staff , but according to a spokesman , the company had recently contributed a recru@@ it@@ ment responsibility for boosting the need for pop@@ ul@@ ism and inclusion .
for her own point , she said she will keep the sn@@ ap@@ c@@ hat account closed , adding that &quot; i wonder if this is necessary for more users , like us , that it is right . &quot;
con@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ onal panel says military officials fal@@ se@@ ly wo@@ o intelligence
a congress pan@@ eli said in a report released on thursday that he was ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating intelligence reports to draw more optimistic attention to the actions of the united states of the united states in the fight against the islamic state in iraq and syria .
a inter@@ con@@ ne@@ c@@ tor report from a working col@@ um@@ n on the military service committee , the intelligence committee and the heads of the republican committee for defence , found that their su@@ peri@@ ors were &quot; a widespread dis@@ satisfaction &quot; among central command analysts , who said that the us forces had changed the as@@ se@@ s@@ s@@ ments of the islamic state .
known as cen@@ t@@ com , it is a military headquarters at the central command , t@@ amp@@ a , f@@ la . that controls us army operations in the middle east and central asia .
&quot; the intelligence results that have been confirmed by the senior cen@@ t@@ com leaders show more positive results than the fact in the field of preventing terrorism in the first place , and constantly offer more positive results than the analysis of other mo@@ tives of the intelligence community , &quot; the report said .
&quot; what &apos;s going on in cen@@ t@@ com is unacceptable ; our war@@ ri@@ ors have suffered their frustration while presenting bad analysis to high @-@ level decision @-@ making authorities , &quot; says cal@@ ver@@ t , a representative of the cal@@ i@@ for@@ n@@ it@@ ar@@ ian republican representative .
failure in cen@@ t@@ com reached the organisation &apos;s highest levels .
the 10 @-@ page report also de@@ ta@@ ined permanent problems in 2014 and 2015 , as part of the central command &apos;s ex@@ plan@@ ation and analysis of american training for iraqi forces .
no matter how far it has been said that the late obama administration officials ex@@ changed orders to change the reports , but leaders of the cen@@ t@@ red were pres@@ en@@ tly pres@@ sured to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the work of the islamic state , which is also known as the force &apos;s day and da@@ i@@ z .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central ko@@ mu@@ t press re@@ mark , ba@@ by and congress ex@@ changed significantly more ap@@ pli@@ cable to actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a cen@@ t@@ com official has indicated that a large military attack could be conducted at a time as early as april or may 2015 , in order to put the public out open to mos@@ ul .
iraq &apos;s second largest city , mus@@ ou@@ l , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; in the wake of several months of research , this was clearly understood , &quot; said mi@@ ke po@@ m@@ pe@@ o , the deputy republican representative of kan@@ sa@@ s .
the most senior intelligence leaders of the united states , from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , have man@@ i@@ pu@@ lated the command &apos;s intelligence results in a move that could deal with the threat posed by the i@@ d in iraq .
re@@ pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations established a working arm after learning analysts that information on the islamic state is man@@ i@@ pu@@ lated .
as further ins@@ pec@@ tions continue , the report published on thursday will be far more comprehensive .
another cen@@ t@@ com intelligence is being conducted by the general ins@@ pec@@ tor of the defence ministry .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee also released their own findings thursday , participating in some of the results of the republican working arm .
&quot; the establishment of a very small process in terms of intelligence concerning the cen@@ t@@ com , co @-@ operation and the iraqi security forces between 2014 and 2015 , &quot; said the chairman of the committee &apos;s democratic representative , ada@@ m b@@ s@@ chi@@ ff .
according to mr. s@@ chi@@ ff , the process &quot; has delayed the publication of intelligence results , &quot; analysts have raised the mor@@ ale of mor@@ ale and &quot; does not adequately include the opposing positions . &quot;
but mr. s@@ chi@@ ff and democrats said they did not reach a finding suggesting that the white house ex@@ er@@ c@@ ised pressure on cen@@ t@@ com analysts to set the consequences &quot; pre@@ determined or politically . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress review were announced by the daily be@@ as@@ t on tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that a pen@@ t@@ ag@@ on ins@@ pec@@ tor general , which was launched after complaints by cen@@ t@@ com analysts .
as a pen@@ t@@ ag@@ on spokesman , senior commander patri@@ ck ev@@ ans said he would not comment on the defence ministry &apos;s congress report in the process of re@@ viewing the general ins@@ pec@@ tor@@ ate .
however , he said , &quot; experts might be at odds in some cases over interpre@@ tation of complex data , and have said that the ministry of intelligence and the defence supports healthy dialogue regarding this important national security con@@ si@@ der@@ ations . &quot;
beyond the issue of whether the us @-@ led bombing in iraq and syria pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ds the pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ds . ( this is a case every day carried out by more defence officials ) .
last year &apos;s accusations , however , raised questions about how much president obama could count on central command for the honest assessment of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis points .
criticism about reflecting the reflects islamic state intelligence , cen@@ t@@ com intelligence analyst gre@@ gor@@ y ho@@ o@@ ker wrote an article saying that president george w. bush &apos;s administration should maintain a small force in iraq , despite many analysts , and that he did not consider its occupation after 2003 , and has been under discussion for more than ten years .
mr. ho@@ o@@ ker played an important role in the uprising against the islamic state intelligence .
the attacks against the est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish@@ ments owned by mr. ho@@ o@@ ker &apos;s team against the islamic state , although they put forward last year &apos;s public statements , have concluded that the terrorist group &apos;s financial resources are not sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally affected , as it has built temporary re@@ pres@@ sions to sell oil in the black refinery in kar@@ ab@@ or@@ t , officials concluded .
however , the finding has not been taken out of command , as the times said in september .
cen@@ t@@ com &apos;s statement last year was met with criticism by then @-@ s@@ is@@ ter general l@@ lo@@ y@@ d j@@ . a@@ us@@ tin i@@ ii , who cited several laws in the senate as an extremely positive assessment of the war .
general a@@ us@@ tin has retired in april and the central command replaced by general joseph l@@ . vo@@ tel .
as the us women &apos;s team prepared to face the united kingdom , the us women &apos;s team won the re@@ ins 4 victory over the back@@ drop .
one day after winning three goals in a 6 @-@ 1 victory over japan , k@@ ati@@ e ba@@ m scored the first two goals for the united american women &apos;s cement management team , which beat india 3 @-@ 0 on thursday .
although it appeared to require a permanent five @-@ goal mas@@ k in two matches , the father ( 27 ) said he was not sure if he would do the same before .
&quot; i have no idea , &quot; he said .
i am not the people who keep track of their goals .
speaking , the americans share the top four @-@ 0 in the olympic tournament and first place in the group with britain , which fell in de@@ cor@@ ation thursday after defeating japan 2 @-@ 0 .
britain and the united states will face each other in the final round saturday .
both teams won the quarter@@ finals for the quarter@@ finals , and the match will determine who will finish the group &apos;s matches with six teams .
the team that won the group &apos;s matches , but will not face some for a little longer with the powerful dutch team , the leader of another group that started the quarter@@ finals .
following saturday &apos;s match , however , americans made significant progress in the wake of the london olympics , where they were last among 12 teams .
ba@@ m was that team .
she grew up at blue bel@@ l , pa . ; she was first only 3 when she took the house of s@@ op@@ hi@@ a ( ik@@ i@@ z ab@@ les ) and was the youngest player for the national team at the 16 @-@ year @-@ old team in dre@@ x@@ el .
she missed the 2008 olympics due to her failure to qu@@ ali@@ fy for the last woman .
it came in 2012 , after which many had gone un@@ done for him and his te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes .
the following year , a british coach , cra@@ i@@ g par@@ n@@ ham , was inaugurated and things started to change .
&quot; cultural change , a mentality change , a physical change , &quot; my father says .
we are no longer working as in london .
we were completely transformed .
on thursday night , my father took the first le@@ g of his life into a closely @-@ ci@@ r@@ cum@@ stance , and the first half the first .
although the team had not yet won a victory , it managed to maintain the score -- 1 @-@ 0 -- until the third quarter , when the father activ@@ ated .
he made a co@@ me@@ dy with his hand from the left , then res@@ hu@@ ff@@ led to the ball and threw it in the ball , which he said made the am@@ er@@ ic@@ als 2 @-@ 0 .
me@@ lis@@ sa g@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ es scored last goal towards the fourth quarter .
it was the first time us go@@ al@@ ke@@ e@@ per jac@@ ki@@ e bri@@ g@@ gs , whose first three vic@@ tor@@ ies allowed them to score a goal .
his chances were announced .
so is my father .
&quot; we are now in a good place , &quot; par@@ n@@ ham said . &quot; but it depends on how good this location is , &quot; he added .
tragedy in the middle of olympic ambitions
whatever is , the olympics are still taking place , regardless of how long is it .
ri@@ o de jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o represents a ri@@ val@@ ry and a study that th@@ r@@ il@@ ling , and it can never be finished or avoided .
the olympic tor@@ ch , like a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast sp@@ ur@@ red on the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast , was put out of the g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast and a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast .
you can &apos;t watch television without hearing anything about the fe@@ u@@ d bil@@ ling between si@@ mon@@ e bil@@ es , k@@ atic or michael p@@ helps and c@@ los , or can &apos;t listen to what you have been a long way to your neighbour at a c@@ af@@ é .
and there is also the lo@@ gan do@@ o@@ ley .
a g@@ am@@ mer@@ ing heart attack -- like a sw@@ im@@ mer , a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast or a f@@ en@@ c@@ er -- could be one of the names during the day of prime time , among tv adverti@@ se@@ ments making the first lau@@ re@@ ate , sp@@ on@@ sor@@ s and self @-@ censorship good .
however , la@@ ke fo@@ res@@ t is v@@ ying for the gold medal at the olympic games , in which cal@@ i@@ for@@ n@@ ia &apos;s mr. do@@ o@@ ley ( 28 ) .
the olympic al@@ ev@@ i event does not provide an equal light .
the centre has sports that in part don &apos;t get uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ally recognised in the sha@@ de : air ri@@ f@@ le shooting , arch@@ ery , ba@@ d@@ min@@ ton , te@@ k@@ li@@ do .
always , it will be us to form a rule , and always wishes for a long time to come .
however , i would like to point out that i like to see what i like , for example , a secret to which i would like to draw attention .
although known as an olympic event since 2000 , when both the tra@@ mb@@ ol@@ in sydney games were presented , few in the 16 years did not realise it was an olympic sport .
this could be a regional cor@@ p@@ se .
although the united states has sent its athletes for the competition , it has never won a medal in its tra@@ m , and has never been a con@@ te@@ stan@@ t who reached the finals until 2012 .
in men &apos;s events , the awards were for chinese and russian , while in the women tra@@ ine@@ es and can@@ na@@ bi@@ s shared .
ros@@ ie ma@@ c@@ len@@ n@@ an of china and canada will seek to protect the gold medals they received in london this year .
but tra@@ mb@@ ol@@ in tou@@ gh@@ er as an event , which in part can be attributed to the fact that she is a re@@ co@@ g@@ ator at the pal@@ y@@ ac@@ o school , instead of the olympics .
i should admit that i was not a speci@@ al@@ ist here , but i have only p@@ len@@ ty to do .
the co@@ mic potential is there -- it reflects the th@@ r@@ one of two sports -- gymnastics and the s@@ kul@@ ls -- which it provided in the form of a car@@ toon such as the car@@ toon , which has created an en@@ de@@ mic po@@ t that has never been finished .
the term &quot; tra@@ mb@@ ol@@ in , &quot; which comes from spanish words , makes it &quot; tra@@ mp@@ le , &quot; meaning &quot; tra@@ mp@@ le . &quot;
the event &apos;s candidates are s@@ it@@ u@@ ated to an almost 30 f@@ ite high at a large tra@@ m , and are being asked to carry out a series of actions ( sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ships , p@@ ip@@ e and sal@@ to ) before they take their feet over .
according to the official olympic programme , they are assessed according to executive , hard time and &quot; flight subsidies . &quot;
thir@@ ty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , including 16 men and 16 women , will compete in ri@@ o .
the most frequent progress ever made at the olympics is direct .
those who hope to win medals should end up in some cases in search of gold , and in some cases , they should go back , with more or less moves taken , faster and higher .
not only did they follow the finish line or the initial wall , but at the same time on tv , there is another difficult line on the broadcast ; the world is the olympic record .
this en@@ de@@ av@@ our is is in the as@@ il , gen@@ tle , and even in extreme levels , and it is sufficient to dro@@ wn a crowd of te@@ et@@ h .
however , it is exactly what i &apos;ve found , as i follow the games .
tra@@ mb@@ ol@@ in provides the right to give you all that at a time .
those who are tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ked are upper move .
the goal is not to move forward .
the upper a@@ x@@ is , as@@ tr@@ on@@ au@@ ts such as as@@ tr@@ on@@ au@@ t , is more ap@@ pe@@ aling to the upper interest , more or less .
of course , whether competition or difficulties is not going to happen during the rout@@ ine , but there is no g@@ li@@ mp@@ se to achieve the outcome of the rout@@ ine , there is no loss to sal@@ v@@ ation . just like time , where the sub@@ mission will be suspended in an un@@ th@@ in@@ k@@ able way .
regardless of how high a olympic race can be d@@ ing@@ hi@@ p .
the women &apos;s rankings and the finals will be held in the afternoon of friday afternoon , with the men again in 13 on saturday .
the n@@ bc will issue the finals in both days , up from 14@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0 , as a bloc .
in the middle of their olympic ma@@ dness , they promise a silent and won@@ der@@ ful moment that can be ignored in general bra@@ w@@ l .
and if the united states , according to the wall street journal , offers men more to sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fy and ex@@ c@@ lu@@ de just as men &apos;s g@@ y@@ p@@ si@@ es had recently proposed , we can say that mr. do@@ o@@ ley expects new fans .
&quot; a generation of protests &quot; in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , a lon@@ g@@ time us ally
violence @-@ based protests in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia
protesters who demanded political change in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia have faced fierce resistance from the government .
he says a large number of protesters have taken le@@ th@@ al arms co@@ u@@ ps in clashes with police .
is eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia about to collapse ?
over the past ten years , african economy has been one of the most stable nations in the region and a solid ally of the west , with its economy growing rapidly .
however , anti @-@ government protests in recent months have shak@@ en up the country , spreading more ten@@ tac@@ les to other regions .
last week alone , thousands took to the streets to demand basic political changes .
according to human rights groups , the government &apos;s reaction to it was extremely painful .
the police officers shot and killed a large number of un@@ armed demonstrators , he said .
security officials break their hands and stand by the wall after a rally that was believed to have taken place at the end of last year or early this year . &#91; officials of the security forces &#93;
at the highest level , the un human rights official would like to see a thorough review .
&quot; it has always been hard to keep this country together , and moving forward will be much more difficult , &quot; said ras@@ hi@@ d ab@@ di , project director at the international crisis group &apos;s so@@ mal@@ ia peninsula , a research group .
eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia is the country &apos;s population of the top nations after ni@@ ger@@ ia and is ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ated by the west .
the us military and intelligence services are working closely with eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians to combat terrorist threats in the region , especially so@@ mal@@ ia , and there is very few countries in africa that have received help from the west .
eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s economy is growing impressive .
infrastructure has been improved effectively ; a new su@@ bur@@ ban rail would be located in the capital , ad@@ di@@ s a@@ ba@@ ba .
and their streets are usually qu@@ i@@ et , safe and clean .
although the latter has not always shown the best example of democracy in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , ( human rights groups constantly referred to the government &apos;s op@@ pres@@ sive attitude ) , opposition within the country was extremely restri@@ cted , with opponents being effective .
most were sent to ex@@ ile , imprisonment , sla@@ u@@ ghter or cl@@ os@@ est cor@@ ners .
but that could be for change .
se@@ j@@ ou@@ m te@@ sho@@ me , a university professor from central eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , said &quot; if you are su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ating people and don &apos;t give them other options than the protest , they interest . &quot;
youth is in total protest .
one generation protest .
there are many complaints , ranging from land use to pressure on the power of the ruling coalition .
following last year &apos;s highly critical election , the ruling party and its allies also received their last arm of fil@@ ling opponents and can now control 100 per cent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions on the border with er@@ it@@ re@@ v@@ ri , which led to the war in june that killed hundreds of people , and the conflict on the border has increased .
analysts fear that separatist groups , such as the or@@ o@@ m@@ o freedom front or the o@@ ga@@ den national freedom front , in recent years will be eliminated from this type of b@@ las@@ ts and weapons .
there is a few factors which , for years , explains why hard @-@ line fe@@ el@@ ings have been growing .
first , he appears innocent : w@@ ise phones .
a large number of eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians began contact the country &apos;s social media just a few years ago , as cheap phones can be promoted and internet service funded .
although the government had banned access to facebook and t@@ w@@ it@@ ter , especially as it often used to during the protests , most were able to communicate via internet you who hide their position .
a few young eth@@ i@@ op@@ ians said they were gathering in this way for the protests .
se@@ con@@ dly , solidarity among the two major ethnic groups in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia -- the orthodox and am@@ bul@@ ances -- has increased .
the orthodox and am@@ u@@ se@@ ments are not normal@@ ly allies .
for too long , am@@ bul@@ ances in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ ering mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ ering mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ ering and operating mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ ers in eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s predominantly christian mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ ering mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ ers have been imp@@ li@@ ca@@ ted in what is mostly muslim .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are going forward to gather under an um@@ bre@@ l@@ la and to co @-@ operate , &quot; said mu@@ la@@ t@@ u ge@@ me@@ ch@@ u , an or@@ o@@ m@@ o leader .
the biggest protests were held in the am@@ har@@ a and or@@ o@@ m@@ o areas .
most of them am@@ har@@ a and or@@ o@@ m@@ o think eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia was divided by members of the military , intelligence services , trade and policy @-@ making ti@@ gra@@ m ethnic group , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population .
the third cause of the in@@ sur@@ gency was the death of me@@ les z@@ en@@ a@@ w@@ i .
he served as prime minister of eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia for 17 years , until 2012 , from an uni@@ den@@ tified disease to an un@@ disclosed il@@ l@@ ness .
it was thought to be a tac@@ tic de@@ te@@ ction that everyone would not see .
analysts say he is especially specialised in i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ ying the initial signs of discontent and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating opponents .
&quot; the current regime does not have this basic knowledge , &quot; said conflict analyst bay ab@@ di .
the new prime minister of eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , ha@@ il@@ e@@ mari@@ us de@@ sal@@ n , was chosen in un@@ am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity to fill in mr. me@@ les .
mr. me@@ les from the ti@@ gra@@ y region of north eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia , unlike mr. ha@@ il@@ i , is south .
analysts say he has failed to gain security confidence in the security services that the ti@@ th@@ ers control .
as a result , further fear took place .
his last experience of this kind of tur@@ n@@ around was the protest in 2005 following th@@ i@@ ev@@ es by thousands of people following the government &apos;s re@@ bel@@ lion .
although more than a month ago , many protesters were killed and have gone faster than last month when measures to ar@@ ise this con@@ fu@@ sion .
development experts commen@@ ded eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia &apos;s leaders for significant progress in har@@ bour@@ ing infrastructure , such as the new one , and the fight against poverty .
it is clear , however , that this has not halted the v@@ ali@@ dity of en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m towards the eth@@ i@@ op@@ ian government .
and this is a dangerous and ethnically motivated situation .
last month , protesters at g@@ on@@ dar , a town in the town of am@@ har@@ a , attacked businesses owned by ti@@ gra@@ des and pro@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to a rise in the social media .
analysts say the protests left other allies in the united states and the west st@@ range .
the us government used eth@@ i@@ op@@ ia as a base for un@@ man@@ ned aircraft on neighbouring so@@ mal@@ ia , but was recently said to have been closed .
although the west wants to promote democracy , it does not want its ally in a fra@@ il @-@ out area to be tor@@ n apart .
&quot; this is just us , &quot; he said . &quot; it &apos;s like to walk on a very sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally too late . &quot;
donald tr@@ um@@ p cites obama &apos;s claim that he had co@@ founded i@@ d as &quot; dece@@ ption &quot;
donald j@@ . tr@@ um@@ p tried to remove the last conflict around the campaign , insisting last week that president obama and hillary clinton have been serious of the islamic state terrorist group &apos;s &quot; fo@@ under@@ s . &quot;
his statement raised new questions about the re@@ p@@ ut@@ ational candidate &apos;s ability to publicly communicate with the american people .
at the same time , it has put mps in a st@@ range position in the process of trying to explain what they can do to defend him in the complicated process .
mr. tr@@ um@@ p insisted that after re@@ commen@@ ding that at a rally wednesday night , he had more re@@ infor@@ ced his resolution thursday , imp@@ lying that she and her woman , clinton , actually established the initiative .
however , m@@ r tr@@ um@@ p was quoted as telling reporters through t@@ w@@ it@@ ter early friday morning .
the reference showed that mr. tr@@ um@@ p completely backed off the charge in a series of inter@@ views , a day before .
conservative radio show hu@@ gh he@@ w@@ it@@ t says he does not believe in this , as mr. tr@@ um@@ p tried to help him rela@@ x that interpre@@ tation .
mr. tr@@ um@@ p has emerged as he attempts to change the campaign following a decline in the polls .
mr. tr@@ um@@ p and women &apos;s clinton spoke with each other about the economy in mic@@ hi@@ gan this week .
on friday , mr. tr@@ um@@ p again sought to turn to the issue .
also speaking via t@@ w@@ it@@ ter , she said her offers would be taxes on women &apos;s bids and that she would have har@@ den@@ ed her speech .
mr. tr@@ um@@ p has previously used his defence .
in late july , after having met with strong criticism after the russian proposals to launch a p@@ i@@ ra@@ ted attack on clinton &apos;s e @-@ ma@@ ils in the event of a p@@ i@@ ra@@ tion , &quot; of course , i said that , &quot; i should have told this in a dece@@ ption . &quot;
this approach en@@ su@@ res mr. tr@@ um@@ p to force political conver@@ gen@@ ce of political conver@@ sa@@ tions and re@@ tra@@ ct the needed location .
ru@@ th s@@ herman , a communications expert who monitors the language used by both candidates , said &quot; it is a order to make a &quot; statement &quot; depending on how certain messages react by those who supported him .
at the same time , however , he speaks k@@ no@@ wing his words and finds it as unclear as to the fil@@ m@@ go@@ ers when it comes to different cur@@ ren@@ cies .
mr. tr@@ um@@ p , after being recently de@@ cre@@ as@@ ing in the polls , took a much more aggressive stance , rather than sof@@ ten@@ ing the mood for the general election audience .
a new n@@ bc / wall street journal / mar@@ ke@@ ti , released on friday , showed that mr. tr@@ um@@ p is behind the northern corner , v@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and col@@ or@@ ad@@ o , and that she is in a tight race in fl@@ ori@@ da .
although she re@@ fra@@ ins the ap@@ ology for provo@@ c@@ ative things usually said the tr@@ um@@ pe@@ t , she has accused her of di@@ ver@@ ting the critics &apos; promises or failing to understand his mor@@ als .
but m@@ r tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s pu@@ b@@ li@@ city , which has suffered much more scrutiny in the last months of the presidential campaign , has proved difficult to l@@ ure its sta@@ un@@ ch supporters if his comments were inf@@ lam@@ ing public .
in an interview with cnn , former mayor ru@@ d@@ ol@@ p@@ h w. gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani of new york city , made his best to defend the island at cnn on thursday , as one of the most prominent mo@@ tives in mr. tr@@ um@@ p .
asked about the ac@@ cur@@ acy of mr. tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s scheme that mr. obama and clinton established the islamic state , mr. gi@@ u@@ li@@ ani said &quot; i think it is a legitimate , political cri@@ tic . &quot;
in some respects , the i@@ d was a small group that was not before obama , it was a sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to them completely fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful and this was due to the withdrawal of its soldiers from iraq .
many critics argue that her administration , as foreign minister , has failed to deal aggres@@ sively with the situation in the middle east and has left it with the office of the secretary @-@ general .
ahead of friday &apos;s r@@ allies in pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , tr@@ um@@ p t@@ w@@ it@@ ter continues to press the news on its own for every word , b@@ lam@@ ing and con@@ tem@@ pt .
&quot; they cannot do that ! &quot; he said , al@@ lu@@ ding to tv experts , who tried to solve him .
some democrats , mo@@ ur@@ ning their le@@ g by mr. tr@@ um@@ p , said it was evidence that he was not eligible for the post .
once el@@ med up with prices in c@@ af@@ e gre@@ en@@ po@@ invest , which once turned out to be el@@ u@@ sive

they are also sold to a so@@ ap cher@@ ie ka@@ p ke@@ k , who replaced ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 .
some people in the region don &apos;t know that this is the last loss of the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ able city .
&quot; new york is a change , i know , &quot; he wrote to mol@@ ly cra@@ b@@ ap@@ le . &quot; i know , this , however , that c@@ b@@ g@@ b is gone and ch@@ el@@ sea is being evacu@@ ated and i cannot believe that ver@@ b is a store now . &quot;
but new york is the city to re@@ start as much as change .
a newly renovated ver@@ b c@@ af@@ e was launched in green@@ point last november , less than a million away from its original position .
the new e@@ ver@@ b has a c@@ af@@ e w@@ i @-@ fi connection and acknowledges a credit card , but pre@@ serves some former workers and the simple tone .
coffee is still good .
c@@ is@@ co ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z , the owner and director of the new station , is the new location for long @-@ term employees .
he joined the ver@@ b in 2001 and until the very end .
one cu@@ sto@@ mer said he would be ex@@ cited when he offered the funding for this new location .
mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z ( 36 ) , many left the same .
ver@@ b uses the same dist@@ ri@@ but@@ or for the registry , and bought an es@@ pres@@ so ma@@ ch@@ ine from the same model .
even the li@@ ghts of the old ver@@ b were re@@ in@@ stated there .
but mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he wants to offer some var@@ i@@ ed experiences .
new in@@ gre@@ di@@ ents were added .
the pac@@ k@@ aging and eg@@ g @-@ and @-@ che@@ es@@ e san@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ h@@ ers also offer materials , such as back @-@ and @-@ th@@ um@@ b , on board .
es@@ mer @-@ pir@@ in@@ ic co@@ ff@@ ins exist .
the c@@ af@@ e is no longer doing the beer service , but it offers fresh fru@@ its .
nine months later , mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he realised the former de@@ si@@ g@@ ners were starting to come forward de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ vely .
&quot; many of our former clients could not cope with the prices in wil@@ li@@ am@@ s@@ bur@@ g , &quot; he said .
last sunday , rec@@ ca oli@@ r@@ a was among those customers .
she lives in wil@@ li@@ am@@ s@@ bur@@ g , where she was often headed to ver@@ b .
he didn &apos;t stop moving to gre@@ en@@ po@@ int , even after he moved to the green line .
after the closure , ver@@ b said he chose to drink coffee for a period of time .
&quot; i noticed that what i lov@@ ed was a coffee and culture in ver@@ b , &quot; she said .
now he has started drinking coffee , but the last day he chose a new p@@ ip@@ e with his regular ice bro@@ wn instead .
another pat@@ ron , to@@ m ros@@ en@@ th@@ al , travelled regularly to ver@@ b starting in 2003 .
she was there before and gave the order .
&quot; every day , i had entered the o@@ at@@ h of seven , i had no shock , i was well and every day they had prepared a trans@@ cri@@ pt order of the e@@ dge order , &quot; she said .
photo mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he wants to make a change and he added the men@@ u to new materials .
no@@ w@@ ada@@ y@@ s , mr. ros@@ en@@ th@@ al is still taking his order at all times , at a certain change in its own hands by adding to each day &apos;s sy@@ m@@ pos@@ ium , eg@@ g and che@@ es@@ e .
mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said he was not con@@ st@@ ru@@ cting to s@@ mu@@ g@@ g@@ le store , which replaced the old venue .
ju@@ d@@ ging by his mind , the owners of so@@ ap cher@@ ie offered to do a special di@@ et for the tax using a coffee that had en@@ ci@@ r@@ c@@ led into the head of the c@@ af@@ e .
&quot; i think that we can still accept this offer , &quot; mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said .
and many of gre@@ en@@ po@@ in@@ te &apos;s traditional polish residents embra@@ ced it .
one of the new customers was able to trans@@ late the men@@ u into le@@ u@@ ke@@ mia , and mr. ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ e@@ z said his new neighbours would soon find an area to demonstrate that origin so they can feel good .
the new position has other advantages .
the local ju@@ bil@@ ee water store is trying to in@@ j@@ ec@@ t and sell the cold de@@ bri@@ s .
the c@@ af@@ é is likely to spread across the building in the t @-@ shi@@ r@@ t building .
for most customers , it is only necessary that a new ver@@ b be available , if they find the old favour@@ i@@ tes .
joseph wh@@ it@@ t was a regular cu@@ sto@@ mer and was so sor@@ ry after the shut@@ down .
when the newly opened venue , mr. wh@@ it@@ t said he felt like to go in and buy coffee at his house .
&quot; i had to put it out , &quot; he said .
time of crisis , lo@@ w@@ ing to &quot; a s@@ qu@@ are me@@ al &quot; in his book
in march 19@@ 33 , fran@@ k@@ l@@ in de@@ lan@@ o ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t was at the ov@@ al office , just after she held the post of president .
one san@@ k to the bos@@ ph@@ or@@ us , president ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t , lov@@ ed the f@@ lo@@ o@@ ded fi@@ gh@@ ter , such as the san@@ d@@ w@@ ic@@ h@@ ine and mar@@ y@@ land kap@@ lum@@ p@@ in , was likely to enjoy the ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
the origin of that sunday &apos;s men@@ u was much more modest : p@@ y@@ ra@@ mid @-@ sa@@ mp@@ led eg@@ gs , pot@@ at@@ o@@ es and p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ tic pow@@ der .
&quot; it was an act of solidarity with those who have suffered hard@@ ship , &quot; jan@@ e zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man said .
his wife , and@@ re@@ w , added : &quot; this was also a message to americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who lives in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n he@@ i@@ gh@@ ts , is a me@@ al h@@ ist@@ or@@ ian .
mr. coe &apos;s latest book , &quot; cho@@ p su@@ e@@ y , &quot; was likely to be heard of chinese cu@@ is@@ ine in america , and in her book &quot; 97 or@@ char@@ d , &quot; it ex@@ changed life in the lower east region in the region of or@@ char@@ d .
&quot; a s@@ qu@@ are me@@ al , &quot; a new book she works together and will be published by har@@ per on tuesday , per@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing the history of american fo@@ o@@ ds during the great de@@ pression .
themselves , they have demonstrated solidarity with the me@@ al , meeting with a reporter for the me@@ al of e@@ is@@ en@@ berg san@@ d@@ vic in the area of fla@@ ti@@ r@@ on , which has become part of the crisis since 19@@ 29 , when the crisis began .
female zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man ( 54 ) , kre@@ m pe@@ y@@ n@@ li and z@@ e@@ y@@ tin@@ li san@@ d@@ vic order , while mr. coe ( 57 ) pre@@ fer@@ red to take the re@@ ins , pot@@ at@@ o@@ es , pot@@ at@@ o@@ es and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
the couple found the reporter &apos;s order in r@@ ul@@ o coal to be discussed with crisis dis@@ hes .
&quot; they were very popular , &quot; said the woman &apos;s zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man .
the venue had its b@@ lun@@ ted sound , je@@ wel@@ ler@@ y , be@@ ans and be@@ ans pow@@ der .
these were cheap things that spread the material with a material .
imagine you eat enough space at din@@ ner .
mr. coe put his face on the sur@@ face .
&quot; one should have se@@ ated as a bul@@ let , &quot; he said .
in the years leading up to the crisis , bas@@ ics in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side area , especially in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , were open @-@ ended .
they were coo@@ king for men working at the farm and served with coo@@ king cu@@ is@@ ine , lun@@ ch food and din@@ ner food .
americans were sending fo@@ o@@ ds to the europeans who died of hunger during world war i . &quot; a s@@ qu@@ are me@@ al &quot; explains the history of how the nation could soon be a centre for ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion .
&quot; this was a time when the din@@ ner became a central , al@@ ar@@ ming an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y for the americans , &quot; the m@@ r coe said , announcing the reasons for his and her wife &apos;s call to write about the issue .
the new budget regime was equally wor@@ r@@ ying : he@@ ar@@ ings such as so@@ mun@@ iti@@ ons and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les became a main product of con@@ fi@@ gur@@ ation , and women &apos;s zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man was &quot; great method for ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating the remaining dis@@ hes &quot; and dece@@ iv@@ ing equipment to under@@ p@@ in a kre@@ s .
dri@@ ves were placed on the site of fresh fruit , which is cheaper .
a meat found at the centre of us food for many years became a lu@@ x@@ ur@@ ious luxury .
the interesting mar@@ ti@@ al mi@@ x@@ ture , or the general hap@@ p@@ in@@ es@@ s , was off@@ ended by interesting mi@@ x@@ ture for the value of th@@ or@@ ny and n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent .
the woman &apos;s zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man re@@ se@@ ar@@ ched for her book , which also included the re@@ ci@@ p@@ es , while re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ating the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator from that period in a s@@ ca@@ m ov@@ en bak@@ ed in the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss .
&quot; this din@@ ner table was not a popular contribution on the table , &quot; he said .
the woman &apos;s zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man supported it . &quot; this fact was true . &quot;
there are no common points in the ov@@ en sho@@ w@@ er &apos;s ov@@ en .
most home economies s@@ it@@ u@@ ated in their fields .
experts from the house economy , including lou@@ ise stan@@ ley , who heads the federal house economy office , led the country &apos;s di@@ et habi@@ ts from 19@@ 23 to 19@@ 43 as never before .
screening and articles published in newspapers and ma@@ gaz@@ ines , encouraging women to be &quot; sav@@ ing sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ ality , &quot; and promoting the fight to turn the match into le@@ u@@ ke@@ mia for le@@ u@@ ke@@ mia @-@ sw@@ ir@@ led food , such as car@@ t spa@@ ge@@ t@@ ti .
the &quot; a s@@ qu@@ are me@@ al &quot; is a non @-@ historic fe@@ ast .
the respon@@ ses given by president her@@ ber@@ t ho@@ over to the government &apos;s hun@@ gr@@ y citizens , such as the up@@ set on my cak@@ e , were very ex@@ cep@@ tional .
he paid tri@@ but@@ e to public fo@@ o@@ th@@ il@@ ls such as mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e mil@@ l , while at the same time turning it into mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e .
&quot; he lov@@ ed europe cu@@ is@@ ine , such as a soci@@ et@@ al fish on an ep@@ ide@@ mic , &quot; he said .
their food was pla@@ u@@ sible in the c@@ er@@ e@@ mon@@ ial room , where they used to wear the ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les in the din@@ ner and din@@ ner .
it was extremely far from reality .
his wife , ele@@ an@@ or , could have come to the same line , though he could not encourage him to be an example with mi@@ de@@ si .
according to the book , the woman began offering only the &quot; most back@@ ward food &quot; set up at the white house , when ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t recru@@ ited a man who never car@@ ed about le@@ z@@ el@@ ine , but also the most notorious co@@ ff@@ ins .
after the country was re @-@ unrest , most of the ways of making a me@@ al during the crisis are put aside .
according to her woman , zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man , understanding of cal@@ or@@ ph@@ an and n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ent understanding and the way science is applied to food .
at the time of the book , the couple said that in his writing , she had learned a lot from the e@@ ating habi@@ ts of her mother , k@@ is@@ sing food -- for example , never to fo@@ ot the me@@ al .
&quot; the food waste name was really ter@@ ri@@ ble , &quot; he said .
the woman &apos;s zi@@ e@@ ge@@ l@@ man spoke about his former me@@ m@@ or@@ ies : &quot; really people are si@@ ck , &quot; she said .
there were cases of fe@@ as@@ ting gar@@ ba@@ ge .
after gathering tab@@ les in e@@ is@@ en@@ berg , he and mr. took a tas@@ te of a house @-@ prepared tas@@ te : the dri@@ ed tas@@ te that president ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t gave in his lun@@ ch &apos;s lun@@ ch .
&quot; the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar d@@ ry @-@ bo@@ ar@@ ded for it , &quot; she added , adding that the most frequent fe@@ at was to give an ap@@ i@@ e@@ ce to these modest fields .
he didn &apos;t have the dis@@ count ; he was just a bit b@@ lin@@ d , some un , sugar , water and fields .
everybody h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to cl@@ us@@ ter in a coffee shop that makes blood fe@@ u@@ ding .
it was not surprising .
he received the coe , the second , and third .
&quot; it would be good part of a bit of s@@ nak@@ e that would have come down , &quot; his wife , like someone who could have been w@@ it@@ ne@@ s@@ sing .
gil@@ e@@ ad , he@@ p@@ ati@@ tis to receive lawyer salaries in he@@ p@@ ati@@ tis fight against he@@ p@@ ati@@ tis
under the us regional judge &apos;s decision , gil@@ e@@ ad s@@ ci@@ en@@ ce@@ s inc won the right to receive at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys for the he@@ p@@ ati@@ tis p@@ ath@@ en@@ ti case with pharmaceutical producer mer@@ ck &amp; co inc@@ .
after i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ ying a series of mis@@ acts , including us judge mer@@ ck &apos;s bo@@ dy@@ guard personal pri@@ v@@ il@@ e@@ ge and other non @-@ eth@@ ical practices , gil@@ e@@ ad paid $ 200m in compensation for two mis@@ de@@ me@@ an@@ or violations of the e@@ ad &apos;s great success in june .
during thursday &apos;s hearing , us district judge beth la@@ b@@ son fre@@ em@@ an said gil@@ e@@ ad had the right to comp@@ en@@ s@@ ate for salaries made during the trial defence .
the mer@@ ck is trying to catch up with a new generation of he@@ p@@ ati@@ tis c medi@@ cin@@ es , the market &apos;s judge , gil@@ e@@ ad , which can improve more than 90 per cent of li@@ ver patients .
the case dates back to 2013 , when gil@@ e@@ ad and mer@@ ck su@@ ed one of them , where they claimed the ownership of the la@@ b for sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , an active article of gil@@ os@@ e@@ ad medi@@ cin@@ es .
us @-@ backed forces say that me@@ m@@ bic &apos;s control was fully removed from the islamic state
on friday , a spokesman for the group said the us @-@ backed forces took full control of the northern town of me@@ m@@ bic , in the vic@@ in@@ ity of the last islamic state in the city near the border with turkey .
after syrian democratic forces ( s@@ d@@ g ) left a group of in@@ jury in the city , the city is finally clearing it .
the s@@ d@@ g and the me@@ m@@ bic of the alliance &apos;s me@@ m@@ bic military council , on@@ f@@ an dervis , told rou@@ ters that they fre@@ ed more than 2000 civilian hos@@ tages , which were found in the hands of militants .
&quot; the town is now under our full control but we are carrying out to clean up , &quot; he told rou@@ ters .
clinton family won $ 10.@@ 75m in 2015 , and pay 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % as federal taxes
hillary clinton announced on friday the tax statement of the democrats &apos; presidential candidate and wife won $ 10.@@ 75m last year and showing they paid 3@@ 4.@@ 2 per cent in force , 3@@ 4.@@ 2 per cent less than in taxes .
in 2015 , the clinton family contributed about $ 1m to the charity institutions , mostly to the clinton foundation , former president bill clinton won about $ 5.@@ 3m in conver@@ sa@@ tions and the former foreign minister declared $ 3m for his book on the time spent at the state foreign ministry .
clinton &apos;s friend , the us sen@@ ator , v@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , published a 10 @-@ year tax statement with her husband , an@@ ne hol@@ ton .
in 2015 , they paid a 20@@ .@@ 3 per cent federal taxes .
&quot; hillary clinton and ti@@ m ka@@ ine remain the standard for financial transparency , &quot; said clinton campaign ag@@ ent j@@ en@@ ni@@ fer pal@@ mi@@ er@@ i .
by contrast , donald tr@@ um@@ p has been ro@@ un@@ ding off on commitments made before in which his tax statements were made , putting them back and bo@@ o@@ m@@ ing .
it is a tradition that , no matter how long the laws are required , us presidential candidates present their tax statements open to the public .
tr@@ um@@ p and lawyers , a bus@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ person from new york , said that the reason for the rejection of the statements was a control conducted by the administration of the revenues .
in con@@ jun@@ ction with the democratic candidate &apos;s statements , clinton campaign officer ian sa@@ m@@ s put the t@@ we@@ et@@ h in &quot; t@@ we@@ ets . &quot;
on thursday , tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s acting special case michael co@@ h@@ en said that the tra will not allow cnn to publish them until the surveillance is complete .
the group criticised the trust , which also includes the republican candidates for president in 2012 , mitrovica ro@@ m@@ ne@@ y and other re@@ pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations , voiced questions about the essence of the situation , its contribution to charity institutions , business deals and many other links with russia .
clinton appeared on friday after an online video of the top republics that showed them ex@@ er@@ c@@ ising pressure on tr@@ um@@ p over ex@@ plan@@ ation .
on thursday , in an economic speech in mic@@ hi@@ gan , he expressed the problem .
he told the crowd &quot; he has refused to publish the tax statements , &quot; where he told them &quot; every candidate has done for a number of decades . &quot;
pol@@ iti@@ co said the tra had paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s , and on friday , a new york times business department columnist and ac@@ coun@@ tan@@ t said the situation could still continue .
federal tax rates have become a major challenge in the presidential election .
clinton presented a rule proposal to name bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e investor war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ et@@ et , which would have at least 30 per cent pay taxes per year over $ 1m .
obama supports the offer .
last week , at a clinton rally in ne@@ br@@ as@@ ka , o@@ ma@@ ha , the ber@@ k@@ shi@@ re ha@@ th@@ a@@ w@@ a@@ w@@ aj group was already there , challenging the visit to bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t , tr@@ um@@ p and the tax statement .
he said he was passing through monitoring , and that tr@@ um@@ p is &quot; afraid &quot; of voters , not from the tax collection institution .
clinton published tax statements until 2007 on the campaign .
clinton family , currently living in new york , ch@@ ap@@ pa@@ qu@@ a , paid an average rate of about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 , and the combined tax rate re@@ ach@@ es about 4@@ 0.5 per cent .
clinton &apos;s family is in a statement for 2015 , indi@@ c@@ ating that , most of them am@@ er@@ can@@ na@@ bi@@ s , only $ 100 per cent of their income is paid .
ana investments are a low @-@ cost index investment fund , and the clinton family declared that the te@@ me@@ t@@ in@@ es@@ s and interest income are $ 10,000 .
ke@@ v@@ in dra@@ w@@ ba@@ u@@ gh ; the re@@ gu@@ la@@ tor j@@ on@@ a@@ than o@@ ati@@ s
to@@ z red pe@@ p@@ per kon@@ s have been supporting the protection of films in tan@@ zan@@ ia , ke@@ stan@@ e sho@@ w@@ ers .
environmental@@ ists in tan@@ zan@@ ia use an unusual method to prevent the fil@@ ters from entering human settlement ; they put them in con@@ ta@@ in@@ ers full of red pe@@ p@@ pers .
the method proved to be effective , and the h@@ on@@ e@@ y@@ gu@@ i@@ de foundation , a us @-@ based union for con@@ ser@@ v@@ ation with the east was taking steps to promote it ; in the villages of northern tan@@ zan@@ ia , volunteers began training on using four @-@ step methods that do not harm their homes and cro@@ ps .
before , many used lo@@ c@@ ally to defend themselves .
on friday , the world day of fi@@ l is dedicated to the protection of animals .
&quot; we have seen that since our car was developed , the stance in those communities has changed , and now there is greater confidence in the ability to keep the fleet off the land without damaging it , &quot; said da@@ mi@@ an bel@@ l , executive director of hon@@ e@@ y .
the first two steps include keeping the f@@ en@@ cing and hon@@ o@@ ur@@ ing f@@ la@@ v@@ our .
if this is impossible , what is called &quot; red pe@@ p@@ per bul@@ ut@@ u &quot; is being co@@ den@@ a@@ med .

even a bre@@ w@@ er can afford to send his fleet to the op@@ pos@@ ite .
the last resort is to a lo@@ gic , which has caused a lou@@ d , br@@ il@@ li@@ ant explosion that sent air to the air .
the jewish fil@@ m@@ maker was hit by a sho@@ ot@@ out on the sho@@ ot in berlin , which f@@ ro@@ ze israel &apos;s telephone code over the &apos; demand &apos; given the country &apos;s &quot; ex@@ pi@@ red &quot; -- r@@ t news .
a jewish french film producer , in berlin , has sparked media sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism after reve@@ aling that the ke@@ mp@@ in@@ ski br@@ ist@@ ol hotel has failed to list israel &apos;s telephone code , and that the worker put forward his &quot; demands &quot; by arab customers .
cla@@ u@@ de lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the documentary &quot; sho@@ ah &quot; on genocide , voiced his ou@@ tra@@ ge at the ke@@ mp@@ in@@ ski br@@ ist@@ ol hotel in berlin with an open letter to the german broadcaster fa@@ z .
lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find israel on the list of phone co@@ des provided by the hotel in the recent for@@ t@@ night .
however , the country was not among the states that could be subject to direct arrest from the chamber .
how can the new german capital be ru@@ ined and destroyed in berlin , berlin ?
lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
instead , ke@@ mp@@ in@@ ski br@@ ist@@ ol allows israel to search through its own hot@@ line .
the fil@@ m@@ maker reported a rece@@ ption at the hotel &apos;s rece@@ ption in order to get a statement .
the response was &quot; shocked , &quot; lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
the hotel &apos;s secretary described the measure as a &quot; de@@ li@@ ber@@ ate decision of the ke@@ mp@@ in@@ ski @-@ ho@@ te@@ ls administration . &quot;
the ra@@ tion@@ ale for this move was caused by far more sy@@ ner@@ gy with film producers .
&quot; the majority of our guests asked for the write @-@ off of the arab and israeli h@@ ou@@ se@@ wi@@ ves , &quot; he said .
according to su@@ d@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e ze@@ it@@ un@@ g , the israeli ambassador to germany , jak@@ ov ha@@ das @-@ han@@ del@@ s@@ man , described the situation as a &quot; great sha@@ me@@ ful . &quot;
we were hor@@ ri@@ fied and very surprised .
it &apos;s really a sha@@ me@@ ful sha@@ me .
it is a far greater reality that this was done in germany and in such a hotel chain .
there is no need for that to be followed .
we are waiting for the hotel to identify with the necessary outcome , &quot; he said .
the incident has sparked a sharp response in the online environment ; people have described it as a scandal .
some accused ke@@ mp@@ in@@ ski hotel of &quot; su@@ c@@ cum@@ b@@ ing &quot; to the alleged demands of arab clients .
another reference was &quot; ut@@ op@@ ia &quot; by hi@@ gh@@ ligh@@ ting the hotel near a syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gue , in which it was found on kur@@ fur@@ st@@ en@@ dam@@ m street .
according to der sp@@ i@@ e@@ ge@@ l , the hotel said it was the result of &quot; lack of attention &quot; and was apolog@@ ised to lan@@ z@@ mann to sho@@ ot the accusations at the &quot; s@@ pe@@ e@@ dy . &quot;
a representative of ke@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e ze@@ it@@ un@@ g said there was &quot; no direct order not to enter the list of israel &apos;s swift search for the country . &quot;
and she said that they have now added co@@ b@@ ble@@ stone .
police use pe@@ p@@ per sp@@ ray , plastic bul@@ let against bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian protesters
students gathered in the bra@@ o pa@@ ul@@ i town of sa@@ o pa@@ ul@@ o , brazil on thursday to demonstrate the government &apos;s opposition to reforms on the public education system .
police used pe@@ p@@ per sp@@ ray and ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ le@@ ts against the protesters .
the problem began with the fact that police officers tried to dis@@ per@@ se the students , which prompted the police to use ru@@ b@@ ber bul@@ le@@ ts and pe@@ p@@ per gas .
hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to voice their dis@@ satisfaction with the plans .
according to a proposal by sa@@ o director ger@@ al@@ do al@@ ck@@ in , less than 100 public schools will be shut down for savings , and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools .
some of the protesters were found to have written walls against temporary president mic@@ he@@ l te@@ mer .
the last protest came only days after protesters went out in the streets to support the proposed presidential language ro@@ us@@ se@@ ff , which was removed from office by the country &apos;s senate .
russia and iran trade ris@@ es to 71 % -- r@@ t business
according to russian ambassador to iran lev@@ an dz@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade tur@@ n@@ over between moscow and tehran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 % year @-@ on @-@ year .
ever since the international sanctions against iran were lifted , the interest of russian companies doing business in the country increased sharply , he said .
as new companies prepare to provide access to the market , russian companies are maintaining existing ties with iran .
of course , increased trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral co @-@ operation with iran , &quot; he said .
in the first five months of 20@@ 16 , the trade tur@@ n@@ over between russia and iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 % compared to the same period in 2015 , and reached $ 8@@ 5@@ 6m , said .
in particular , russian exports to iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 per cent to $ 6@@ 9@@ 7m .
russian imports from iran rose 16 per cent to $ 15@@ 8m .
&quot; this increase in trade was provided with ma@@ ch@@ in@@ ery , flo@@ ck @-@ and @-@ weapons supplies . &quot;
dz@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan also expects record number of iranian tourists to draw to russia this year .
last year , russia &apos;s diplomatic representative in iran presented 3@@ 5,000 visas to iranian citizens , most of whom were for travel .
in addition , iran was among the top 20 foreign tourists visiting russia for the first time .
we can say that a record of iranian tourists visiting russia last year will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , less russia is visiting iran with a relative sense of hope of changing the envoy .
&quot; i personally suggest the visit of the cities of is@@ fa@@ han , si@@ ra@@ z and ye@@ z@@ d where the monuments of ancient p@@ ers are well hidden . &quot;
ship@@ ments to f@@ et@@ c are in izmir for economic news
the fi@@ ghts that have been taken into custody for providing financial support to f@@ et@@ c have started un@@ covering inter@@ cep@@ tions with the group &apos;s board of directors chairman abdullah kav@@ uk and the chairman of the ku@@ cu@@ kan@@ tic group &apos;s executive board , ahmet ku@@ cu@@ kan@@ ç@@ i .
f@@ et@@ ul@@ l &apos;s financial resources , v@@ 1 and 2 , in izmir , have determined to send a si@@ mu@@ lated amount of money to f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ h gu@@ len , the leader of the c@@ f@@ o / p@@ dy terror group , on a regular basis each month .
money sent to gu@@ len for the failure to pass through the records was found not to be invested in the banks , but was dis@@ pat@@ ched by a member of the organisation , kur@@ d .
meanwhile , 9 people have been detained in am@@ as@@ ya over the alleged f@@ ta coup attempt and arrested in court , including fatih alt@@ in@@ ay , who heads the chamber of commerce and industry , on trial . 7 people were released on condition of criminal control .
in 10 @-@ year term , 30,000 li@@ ra in the poc@@ ket
president recep tayyip erdogan &apos;s call , &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; has moved on to the banks .
first , it was proposed that banks be included in the real estate house , which was then attended by g@@ yo@@ der .
the proposal to reduce housing mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ges to less than 1 per cent was also seen as psychological .
the 13 banks placed interest rates on housing loans at less than 1 per cent .
public banks have since launched the gos@@ pel .
previously , the latest arrangement -- given the monthly interest rates of between 1,@@ 12 per cent and 1.2 billion euros -- will pay less interest between consumer and 30 billion t@@ l , which uses a 10 @-@ year mor@@ t@@ g@@ age .
the choice is 5 per cent
how much benefits will interest reductions be for domestic creditors ?
using a ten @-@ year loan with 100,000 li@@ ra , the one who has been using the loan will provide 30,000 li@@ ra benefits from a lowered interest rate .
the majority of housing loans are selected for the payment plan of 5 to 10 years .
interest rates are expected to drop further in the coming days .
interest reduction will also positively affect sales .
in 2015 , housing sales increased by 10.@@ 6 per cent year @-@ on @-@ year to 1,@@ 2@@ 8@@ 9,000 .
sales are expected to sur@@ pass 1.5m euros in interest this year .
g@@ yo@@ der president az@@ i@@ z tor@@ un : it must be down@@ sized to less than 9 per cent annually
the move is an important step towards public banks &apos; higher interest .
they have heard from the president &apos;s call and lowered rates .
however , it must be below 9 per cent annually .
if this dis@@ count continues , we are planning to extend the monthly interest campaign to 0.@@ 70 months that we are launching .
k@@ uz@@ u group lam@@ b : my campaign could last up to 3 months
the participation of banks in this historic campaign could bring an extension of the period of the campaign by at least three to 4 months , which we limited to one month .
however , the credit interest rates must be lower than 9 per cent year @-@ on @-@ year .
this is very happy to see that only the housing sector and the positive p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric and unprecedented solidarity in the real market , while citizens use the sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce of any business in buying housing .
po@@ la@@ t holding y@@ k@@ b adnan po@@ la@@ t : we expect full support from the banks
it is a good step for us to go to pay cuts after our call to the banks .
apart from that , there are some steps taken to sti@@ mu@@ late the economy in all other sectors .
it is a campaign by ngos , the central bank &apos;s decision and all steps that have taken in that direction ...
all the banks must put their hand under the stone .
you , you and you will join them as well as this one , together with us , on the same path , let &apos;s d@@ ry economic together , let &apos;s d@@ are in the same way .
sa@@ ban@@ ci ne@@ ts 1.5 billion t@@ l investment in 1.5 billion
sa@@ ban@@ ci holding reached 16@@ 6m li@@ ra in the first six months of this year , an increase of net profits by 11 per cent compared to the same period last year , bringing its sales to more than 1 million li@@ ra and 22 per cent .
sa@@ ban@@ ci holding top manager ( ceo ) z@@ af@@ er kur@@ tu@@ l said that in the first six months of the year , they invested 1.@@ 8 billion t@@ l and about 5.5 billion li@@ ra so far .
&quot; we have , as a country , survived a difficult period of time , &quot; he said .
&quot; now it is time to work and produce more for our country . &quot;

the istanbul me@@ tro@@ pol@@ it@@ an municipality ( i@@ bb ) organised the &quot; cab@@ ba@@ ge challenge , &quot; as it was due to renov@@ ations by the trans@@ late centre and the construction of s@@ ke@@ let@@ ons , the cab@@ ba@@ ge v@@ ap@@ ore turkish sea traffic was closed for nearly two years .
a modern transfer centre will be established in the turkish se@@ at@@ as field , com@@ b@@ ining sea , ra@@ f@@ ting system and road transport .

lower interest , household raise
my friend sent a message .
it &apos;s always the same .
interest is falling , and household prices are on the rise .
interest rates are up , and household prices are dropping .
&quot; this is the time the father got so , &quot; he said .
she describes the sen@@ ti@@ ments that come to her because she is related to individual loans .
contractors have entered a campaign of 0.@@ 70 interest rates and have increased prices on various housing projects , according to property housing .
i looked at because that is true .
the situation is f@@ la@@ w@@ ed , there are no more can@@ na@@ bi@@ s ...
then , meanwhile , we got a se@@ al of the ac@@ claimed terrorist organisation that participated in a construction summit organised by our newspaper a week after the july 15th coup attempt on july 15th .
the bos@@ s of a large firm ...
&quot; in fact , you &apos;re going to have the opportunity to deal with the coup ? &quot; he asked , adding that he would not give up his name until after 10 per cent of the prices were announced .
after the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ er@@ n@@ al campaign , construction and a major sales campaign , called property housing , have launched a major sales campaign with a .@@ 70 per cent interest and 120 @-@ month maturity .
i accept his hand , before the banks , the risk was placed under the stone .
&quot; but we are working with unity and an equ@@ al@@ is@@ er to avoid the speed of turkey .
the 1 @-@ month campaign prompted banks to draw interest .
nobody should give an opportunity to increase then .
add to the ly@@ ri@@ cs in the direction .

president recep tayyip erdogan accepted o@@ mer mehmet ali ko@@ c , chairman of ko@@ c holding , as well as acting chairman of the ko@@ c holding board and president of ford ot@@ os@@ an &apos;s board of directors , ali ko@@ c .
erdogan &apos;s motion , which took place in the presidential tr@@ um@@ p at the press , lasted 40 minutes .
b@@ d@@ k call for b@@ d@@ k : take the complaint by those banks
the head of the banking regulation and supervision agency ( b@@ d@@ d@@ k ) , mehmet ali ak@@ be@@ n , explained president erdogan &apos;s warning of &quot; credit back &quot; to the banks .
&quot; if banks turn to an opportunity because of the market &apos;s conditions for re@@ vis@@ ing credit , we certainly can &apos;t allow this if they are turning it with different mo@@ tives , &quot; said ak@@ be@@ n .
&quot; we give us such complaints and information , &apos; we &apos;ll give names on a bank and a company basis &apos; and we &apos;re putting in question with the b@@ d@@ k complaint .
&quot; i &apos;m talking about interest , and when the loans are extended , then we will open a new period in front of both our country &apos;s investors and our banks , both , &quot; president recep tayyip erdogan warned in a statement issued by the banks .
wh@@ o@@ ever it &apos;s stopped si@@ ph@@ oning for our country &apos;s credit at this time is to give them a p@@ ure into the loans , and i want to announce it .
interest rates were 7 per cent to 8 per cent annually , and banks took money from the job .
more than 500,000 russian tourists expected
ali k@@ iz@@ il@@ da@@ g , head of the association of professional hotel ad@@ min@@ ist@@ rat@@ ors ( po@@ y@@ d ) , says turkish @-@ russian relations are on a positive course ahead of the july 15th coup initiative in ex@@ p@@ o 20@@ 16 , while flights from russia to antalya have been launched , and a certain tur@@ n@@ over in tourism .
&quot; i expect very positive developments in all sectors , both from tourism and agriculture , for example , from construction to construction , &quot; said y@@ il@@ di@@ r@@ da@@ g , who is also ex@@ cited that president recep tayyip erdogan and russian president vladimir putin have met with trade @-@ off@@ s .
turkey and russia have very close two countries , traditional relations based on years .
&quot; on this road by the leaders of the two countries , i think we can quickly close the d@@ ist@@ an@@ ces and move towards the goals if we move very fast , &quot; he said .
he said he hoped the number of russian tourists ar@@ ri@@ ving in turkey would exceed 1 million if it were not a coup attempt .
but we lost a month after we were hit by a high season , so the goal is min@@ im@@ ised .
however , i think that if the char@@ ter takes the flight , we will sur@@ pass 500,000 .
then there is the reason for the season to be extended to the middle of october , even by the end of october .
in such a situation , additional flights may be available per year .
i predict that this positive tone will be very well regarded by the russian people as well .
they too have an disease for turkey .
i think that with this momentum we &apos;ll have to build up to 7@@ 00,000 troops .
he said he is hopeful for 20@@ 17 as well as for the russian market , adding that the two countries &apos; relations and the number of russian tourists could grow by more than 3 million next year .
by lifting the ban on public staff , the domestic re@@ ser@@ vo@@ irs began small , &quot; according to po@@ y@@ d chairman k@@ iz@@ il@@ la@@ h . &quot; there are rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing returns in image re@@ ser@@ v@@ ations , and new re@@ ser@@ v@@ ations have also started to be taken . &quot;
&quot; we have hope of e@@ id @-@ ul @-@ ad@@ ha , &quot; he said .
he also said that lifting a ban on selling tickets to iranian travel agencies after the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at was also a very positive development . &quot; if we can bring 100,000 to 100,000 people a month from iran , it would be very good , &quot; he said .
defeat , an existing loan ?
first , they meet with the bank when you get a loan , learning how the new interest conditions are how to influence the credit .
pay for early closure , along with a lower interest of up to 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of the cost used for the loan , is calcu@@ lated from the bank .
if you are included in all costs , you can still apply for a favourable , low @-@ interest loan use .
there is no bre@@ ath@@ ing for as@@ l@@ an !
the last five @-@ be@@ si@@ kt@@ as are aiming to win the super cup she will play with the gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , entering the new season as well .
&quot; we should play tem@@ p@@ o and aggressive , &quot; said coach sh@@ en@@ ol gun@@ es , who founded his plans on all tri@@ cks .
&quot; i &apos;m waiting for the high percentage of the p@@ as and the ball over 90 minutes , &quot; he said .
sh@@ en@@ ol gun@@ es that mis@@ led the id@@ ps , especially soci@@ a sa@@ usage , were found to be un@@ decided about ad@@ ri@@ ano and qu@@ ar@@ a@@ bic .
the veteran coach tried ne@@ ci@@ p during a training session within the week , but he will play ad@@ ri@@ ano in the col@@ um@@ n in the left , serving as ad@@ ri@@ ano .
the sun , which will also serve as a choice between ri@@ car@@ do qu@@ ar@@ es@@ ma and ker@@ im fre@@ i , is also equipped for the ball after a long break on its demands .

dur@@ sun oz@@ be@@ k said that the football team had come to a much better position than last year . &quot; still , i need to talk about football , not about me on the field , &quot; he added . &quot; i cannot say anything , &quot; he added .
i can see the teams for 2 @-@ 3 weeks ; then i can say we have a chance to win the championship .
i expect an explosion from tol@@ ga .
you will see tol@@ ga with his trial , but this year it &apos;s going to explo@@ de , with everyone watching for ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion .
the chairman of the gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay emphasised that they would contact mehmet top@@ al in the period of trans@@ lation , but will activ@@ ate them in the absence of a club . &quot; we have not had the intention of increasing the price , &quot; he said .

at a meeting of the club &apos;s foundation , the club signed a historic verdict .
an agreement to lift the de@@ pl@@ ass@@ ment was reached at a meeting in which the 15 july coup attempt was put on the agenda .
the team will be able to take its seats in the tri@@ bun@@ als and in the be@@ si@@ kt@@ as @-@ bur@@ s@@ as@@ p@@ or events since the new season .
&quot; we have decided to lift de@@ pl@@ as@@ se@@ ments for the continuation of the unity that followed july 15th and of the draw , &quot; said the head of the foundation , go@@ k@@ sel g@@ atic .
&quot; we believe that unity and equ@@ ity are much more important after the 15 july democracy mar@@ ty@@ rs , &quot; he said .
the club union foundation , meanwhile , said it would continue to be up to the current board of directors .
dur@@ sun oz@@ be@@ k , president of the gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay club , was elected as head of the di@@ van .
unlike previous meetings , it noted the lack of any position in the club .
turkish flags were equipped with tab@@ les to em@@ p@@ has@@ ise unity and a draw in turkey .
&quot; we will give ourselves a b@@ lin@@ d o@@ at@@ h . &quot;
a st@@ ori@@ ed attack against turkey &apos;s un@@ divided integrity finds the big turkish nation in the face of its turkish nation , club president go@@ k@@ sel z@@ in@@ da@@ g said , adding that &quot; we don &apos;t have the capacity to alle@@ vi@@ ate the f@@ et@@ c . &quot;
&quot; as a football family , we are all obliged to clean our own gar@@ den and rec@@ over , &quot; he said .
&quot; do you think it &apos;s an or@@ gan@@ is@@ er with the name of the democratic cup of july 15th ? &quot; asked ay@@ da@@ g , &quot; you also have a general wing of friends related to the name of the turkish cup . &quot;
&quot; we will share this offer with t@@ ff , &quot; he said .

hu@@ se@@ y@@ in k@@ l@@ il@@ an &apos;s de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion , de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion hinges on 3@@ 3rd le@@ g collapse
commenting on f@@ et@@ c &apos;s attempt for a coup , hu@@ se@@ y@@ in be@@ si@@ e@@ ged words .
he was sold to the head by hu@@ se@@ y@@ in gun@@ es :
&quot; they could be diagnos@@ ed , but they could not , in a chain of command , &quot; wrote the author of what he wrote in the summer of 5 to 6 months , as he wrote of what he described as a brutal coup against others .
i did not know two things ; first , he was per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve and deep , the 8 @-@ year emir of the me@@ se@@ la gendar@@ mer@@ ie , and the y@@ ou@@ ths of mr. president .
the man who fought the most , choosing how to pay attention to it , but the most important character@@ istic of them is the pri@@ v@@ acy .
they are two centuries cap@@ tive .
&quot; it &apos;s not that a pen@@ sion@@ er like this f@@ et@@ e can do what he can do , &quot; he said . &quot; one of the most important evidence is that it is such a deep cas@@ ino .
ci@@ a receives support .
ci@@ a took it too soon .
mah@@ mu@@ t praised him in 2014 , where he met with fu@@ at east and f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ h at his house in 19@@ 7@@ 1 .
at the time , he said , the most recent time was relations between mi@@ t and ci@@ a , the people interested in these jobs .
we have paid the salaries of personnel from the armed forces in the united states , and this is one man who did not remember them .
when we learn about it , we are doing it in 2014 .
after this summer &apos;s article , mah@@ mu@@ t be@@ y had no ex@@ plan@@ ation for that .
for example , isn &apos;t he fair and isn &apos;t he caught at the base ?
he won@@ ders .
he spent the last 25 days in pen@@ sil@@ ia , 2 days before the coup .
it has been about 1@@ 09 times since fair @-@ free 2002 .
when you bring all this together , one must study the show -- all of them went to the united states starting in march 1999 when they went to the f@@ et@@ ul@@ e , when they went to the united states .
the event will be seen that they went to the pen@@ sil@@ ia with a be@@ ar@@ er .
but ci@@ a and its main contact can be de@@ te@@ c@@ ted from match @-@ fi@@ x@@ ing ; in particular , there have been a lot of people sent to the united states in security terms that have to be raised through the police .
wi@@ kil@@ e@@ ak@@ s has documents ; it est@@ ab@@ l@@ ish@@ es an association and has held joint meetings with ci@@ a .
fi@@ f@@ teen years ago , efforts were made to demonstrate that connections to ci@@ a were made .
fu@@ at av@@ ni av@@ ni is a intelligence pool in the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which i said was only 2 years ago .
ada@@ m av@@ ni , who works as prime minister , works for fu@@ at av@@ ni .
but it &apos;s bad ; this information has fallen to ci@@ a , as it has fallen into pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary .
the de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ tion of gu@@ len depends on the collapse of three sha@@ cks ; one was by the base , which is a friend &apos;s , but the ones who are in deep hi@@ p@@ nothing -- even erdogan &apos;s film , say that the coup coup effort is still a movie .
i have been th@@ ril@@ ling three le@@ ks , a base support .
the stolen questions , theft , the right to k@@ no@@ wing it , proved to be that con@@ tri@@ but@@ or to that base support .
the other two are political support , international support .
international support is still available .
the only thing that would compar@@ e political support is the cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate of the tap@@ es taken by ba@@ y@@ k@@ al and mhp ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion@@ ers .
after july 15th , &quot; mr. kil@@ ic &quot; used his own use , opened everyone &apos;s eyes .
&quot; i &apos;m doing it me here , &quot; he said .
&quot; on my side , the jews in hu@@ se@@ y@@ in hu@@ y said , the girls are seeing so many th@@ ril@@ led dre@@ am@@ s , i &apos;ve sent me , i ban now , because it &apos;s not the right thing to dece@@ ive dre@@ am@@ s , &quot; she said .
there was one audi@@ ot@@ ap@@ e recorded , the person when she saw that voice registry , bar@@ os ko@@ cak@@ ur@@ t : have seen the g@@ ir@@ l@@ friends double the so@@ ap , our che@@ es@@ e dou@@ ts .

coup workers &apos; o@@ be@@ di@@ ence tv trans@@ missions not inter@@ rup@@ ted
private television , which took the key to aver@@ t a coup attempt on july 15th night , continued to spread due to a co@@ her@@ ent resistance to coup pl@@ ot@@ ters in turk@@ sat .
that &apos;s his her@@ o her@@ o@@ ic ac@@ k@@ ay@@ a ...
according to ak@@ k@@ ay@@ a , who had entered the trans@@ cri@@ pt following the release of the declaration in tr@@ t , they had entered the vo@@ cal p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric . &quot; i got everything from the helicopter thinking that my friend were dead . &quot;
they asked for weapons to spread and cut pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations .
i simply closed local tv stations .
then i then managed to get away from the building , saying we should go to the can@@ s .
i spent as much time in the department where we had the an@@ th@@ ro@@ w@@ ers .
&quot; i &apos;ve also cut some cab@@ ins here but did not touch pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations , &quot; he said .
the coup pl@@ ot@@ ters rus@@ h@@ ed to remove the spread of turk@@ sat , which brought tv experts .
instead of the incident , they were arrested by police officers who came three minutes ago .
he said that about 1 hours after returning to the building , he re@@ al@@ is@@ es that tv channels are still in place , and was ne@@ ck @-@ down .
that evening i took over the re@@ ins at 8 pm .
the orchestra was us home .
i was a friend of the e @-@ state and electricity system .
we had to meet to drink as early as 2@@ pm , flying trou@@ bles from our down@@ hill .
the helicopter was also in the vic@@ in@@ ity of the aircraft , which had mu@@ ted silent gun@@ fire .
we have seen their li@@ veli@@ hood .
it was probably the most h@@ um@@ an@@ e air vehicles to be found .
they fle@@ w through the streets of the he@@ li@@ p@@ k@@ s .
11 years later , i was co@@ u@@ gh@@ ing the ni@@ l because for the first time i saw so close flights .
then they started to take a ri@@ de .
we &apos;ve heard about reports that the bridge is closed .
our general manager ordered friends to come to the building for the building , which is not at the time .
we learned that all of the bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ts in the tra have fallen in to obtain information .
train trans@@ missions were cut for 5 minutes .
tr@@ t was hit by a main ro@@ of .
our control station said that tr@@ t pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations have been restored and have begun to read out .
our deputy chief executive , hal@@ il gre@@ il@@ ci@@ men , asked that the tr@@ t be immediately cut off by the director &apos;s orders .
we have started working to cut the publication because tr@@ t has broadcast bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ts across 3 stations .
just before we heard that &#91; prime minister bin@@ ali y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m &#93; had said &apos; th@@ ril@@ ler &apos; .
our principal &apos;s order , &apos; tra &apos; , placed us some resistance to p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric .
we cut the trend and heard some time later the helicopter .
we went out , then s@@ mas@@ h@@ ed in all places , with everyone dis@@ per@@ sed .
on the other side , we are hiding in a building .
we had a total of 12 .
when we cr@@ os@@ sed it , soldiers lan@@ ded by the helicopter entered the service .
we had a few friends .
we have also emerged so that it is not alone .
i saw that they caught our deputy director and had collapsed .
they were speaking am@@ on@@ g@@ st themselves .
&quot; let &apos;s hit one of us , it &apos;s a co@@ me@@ dy . &quot;
and then they sit down all of us .
k@@ im , who is also the commander of the camp , started sh@@ ou@@ ting &quot; i can &apos;t even ask . &quot;
we also heard the kind of &apos; let &apos;s hit &apos; style s@@ pe@@ e@@ ches : we don &apos;t know what we &apos;ve done from home , but we have an instruc@@ tion to us , it &apos;s final &apos; . &quot;
there is resistance .
i felt at that moment that i gave up my own life .
i said &apos; i say &apos; .
i &apos;ve come back to my feet before i knew what to do then .
what i thought at the time was that my helicopter was fired at my friends , ni@@ za@@ m .
i thought there were 10 to 15 friends &apos; lives in ni@@ za@@ m , and thought &apos; finally they would kill us , &apos; i &apos;m going to have cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed th@@ ril@@ ls . &apos; &quot;
all military services , except with the commander of major , were ke@@ se@@ ce@@ q@@ in &apos;s , chief of staff .
we have a system of sy@@ no@@ d when local channels ad@@ or@@ ned .
we are spreading from about 200 local channels to the office , promising 80 of them .
she was there .
there were no national bro@@ ad@@ cas@@ ts .
if i gu@@ ar@@ ded them , and if all say they have been cut , i would have until then my support or the outside .
or i would say it would go anywhere .
we have acknowledged that , in the end , we will not be able to leave .
&apos; i &apos;m gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing me &apos; .
i cut the memory of one of the local channel pac@@ ka@@ ges .
i gu@@ ar@@ ded the power we@@ d@@ ding to the monitors when we could monitor national channels .
thus , there would be no signal in all an@@ no@@ un@@ cements .
i have said that i should not go to the things in order to be completely cut .
he and two soldiers drive for the an@@ ten@@ na .
i opened the room for an@@ ten@@ na , one of them was &apos; or@@ char@@ d &apos; , &quot; he said .
he was named my gun .
i will finally hit , so@@ me@@ where by cutting down all of the tr@@ t except , without one , or at one , by one side , &quot; he said .
and i was told that , now , &quot; all of the time i had g@@ ot@@ ten in my life , i said , nothing more .
we entered the tender , brought together local pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations .
we passed through other an@@ ten@@ na .
then , there was a system in which we would get in hand to the tun@@ e of 20 national channels .
about 20 mon@@ it@@ on@@ ists have entered the door as local channels ke@@ sin@@ k .
ra@@ b@@ bi@@ m helped us so much that he didn &apos;t have a problem when he an@@ s@@ w@@ ered , or tied their pressure .
they believed in the answers we gave .
he didn &apos;t want .
it was a relief from us .
after they emerged from the an@@ ten@@ na , they asked for the tra@@ m to be replaced .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how i have a tv set , &apos; i have no electricity . &apos; i asked you to have an elec@@ tri@@ cian &apos; in your pur@@ su@@ it .
&quot; there &apos;s no electricity after night , if you can , the team said , &apos; come out &apos; .
in fact , he had electricity .
i did not give up the cyprus pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations .
i was also thinking about cutting them to def@@ use them .
they were somewhat reli@@ ev@@ ed because they thought the pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations were being cut .
they were reluctant to look at the pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations .
now the group is on hold .
about an hour later , they opened tv in the waiting room to see that ai@@ red the news .
the de@@ tac@@ h@@ ment is in the presence of soldiers .
my commander does not end the news , &quot; he said .
we were seen with the commander .
&apos; get out &apos; , &quot; he told setimes .
i was gone .
he said a soldier still had pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations which are being carried out .
there are channels broadcasting in cyprus , &quot; he said .
&quot; they are broadcasting over cyprus , they could be told &apos; i could not do anything &apos; to them , &quot; he said .
&quot; then move us all together after da@@ wn with each other , &quot; he said .
coup pl@@ ot@@ ters fle@@ w into a min@@ i@@ at@@ ure of turk@@ sat .
i got a lot of pictures from the army , which took me to the to@@ il@@ et , where he was sum@@ mar@@ ily executed at that min@@ i@@ at@@ ure .
they shot at 3 times , shooting themselves in their hand and he@@ arts .
my friends confirmed that he was the same soldier .
they addressed that corps .
it was probably a soldier .
they could be executed to get ri@@ d of him .
as@@ im ak@@ k@@ ay@@ a said that turk@@ sat came from the first police team , sha@@ q@@ an .
police teams were also involved in helicopters , returning to the town , when they found to know that the safety agents were scan@@ ned , and bought the mun@@ iti@@ ons .
they returned 40 minutes later .
when police teams took the lead , turk@@ sat saw no one in its external intent .
&quot; they called our police teams from us , turk@@ ish@@ ness personnel , we should say , &apos; we should enter into an emergency &apos; , &quot; he said , i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ ying that only 3 @-@ 4 minutes after a police expert sent from the tv station came to the building .
&quot; the police used only one phone call , four of them s@@ c@@ ut@@ tled with an identity @-@ related problem , and reported &apos; we were caught &apos; , &apos; &quot; he said .

ergenekon pi@@ e hits , kil@@ ls f@@ ever
the chief prosecutor &apos;s office of the ankara public prosecutor is re@@ se@@ ar@@ ching his role in the 2009 death of be@@ h@@ xhe@@ t ok@@ ta@@ y , head of the special operations department whose file was closed &quot; suicide . &quot;
the head of the former police department , ramadan ak@@ y@@ u@@ re@@ k , was the chief suspect in the investigation of ramadan ak@@ y@@ u@@ re@@ k , a former special suspect , while he was sp@@ ying on a p@@ ak@@ ist@@ an@@ i terrorist group suspect six days before the death of ok@@ ta@@ y .
some of the ammunition seized as part of the ergenekon probe have been stolen from the police special operations department , where it was found and buried under the arrest of ok@@ ta@@ y .
be@@ h@@ xhe@@ t ok@@ ta@@ y , head of a special operations department at the time , was named &quot; suicide &quot; in ankara from the beginning of february 25th 2009 .
however , there were many questions involved .
two years after the legal campaign and evidence uncovered by family and family at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys , a murder investigation is under way this time .
he was sur@@ vi@@ ving in the p@@ ist@@ ol , who was said to have shot him .
they also de@@ ter@@ red fra@@ ins and bat@@ tal@@ i@@ ons in their b@@ ones .
the trial over the murder investigation opened in may 2012 .
in the murder case , only the we@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ li@@ f@@ ter was tried by bar@@ ber , found next to him when he was killed and found along with bar@@ ut .
they were eventually acquitted .
nur@@ han on@@ der , who was in prison for another criminal off@@ ence and sent a letter to the prosecutor &apos;s office , saying he was med@@ d@@ ling in ok@@ ta@@ y . he was sentenced to six months in prison for &quot; han@@ ging out crimes and tor@@ men@@ ting legal authorities . &quot;
that prosecutor &apos;s office should be investigated
meanwhile , &quot; the suicide is su@@ ici@@ des , &quot; prosecutor hu@@ se@@ y@@ in yal@@ c@@ in re@@ ti@@ re@@ e said , while mustafa proper , who is investigating the murder .
the o@@ ce@@ y family , along with those prosecutors , is also involved in the investigation of par@@ king prosecutor ni@@ hat y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m .
be@@ h@@ xhe@@ t ok@@ ta@@ y &apos;s s@@ is@@ ter , s@@ ul@@ e ok@@ ta@@ y , and her brother ne@@ zi@@ h ok@@ ta@@ y , and family lawyers have made several requests in the trial process .
hal@@ il ke@@ si@@ ci &apos;s killing of a special @-@ trained ok@@ ta@@ y on his own is not possible , the family said , calling for the investigation to be expanded .
the family , who says it has b@@ lasted the incident , called for the de@@ te@@ ction and trial of the police officers who want to de@@ te@@ ct h@@ um@@ in &apos;s and mustafa y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m , as the su@@ ici@@ des they want to de@@ te@@ ct .
the family was rejected , with ok@@ ta@@ y found that it was &quot; ri@@ di@@ cu@@ led with the false &quot; false &quot; name for hi@@ z@@ bul@@ la@@ h , 6 days before his death .
the head of the then department of security intelligence , ramadan ak@@ y@@ u@@ re@@ k , was the head of the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation .
in this development , the turkish public prosecutor &apos;s office , re@@ vi@@ ving the be@@ h@@ xhe@@ t ok@@ ay file , has started to examine the involvement of the terrorist group ( f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ h ) in the murder .
the trial against the ankara heavy criminal court for illegal tap@@ ping in ok@@ ta@@ y is set to begin on 19 september .
t@@ wil@@ i@@ gh@@ t sa@@ ga on the back
the family is hopeful for an current investigation in the morning .
members of the family say that f@@ et@@ tered par@@ ce@@ l par@@ ce@@ ls in the murder during the previous demonstration in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y and trial .
&quot; this murder came to the lake in fact . &quot;
we could not imagine .
&quot; they will give me the food &apos; before my tree was killed .
i said &apos; who &apos; .
i pointed out the f@@ et@@ c at the time .
i believed i was going to be removed .
i never brought my death to my mind .
so , there &apos;s h@@ um@@ our behind this job .
&quot; he was at the hands of them , &quot; he said .

turkey has fought in@@ de@@ fin@@ i@@ te@@ ly to finish the pkk &apos;s terror , a campaign that has left its leaders de@@ m@@ ol@@ ished to avoid ex@@ c@@ lu@@ sion .
militants un@@ le@@ ak@@ ed in critical institutions of turkey worked together to connect turkey &apos;s hand .

a restructuring process was launched at the t@@ s@@ k and the ministry of national defence following the fo@@ il of a coup attempt by members of the terrorist leader f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ h gu@@ len .
a comprehensive clean@@ ing process was launched , especially as military licenses were stolen by the f@@ et@@ c , where non @-@ organisation military students were also sent from schools .
approximately 3@@ 7,000 officers will be deployed with pre@@ cau@@ tions and about 3@@ 9,@@ 2@@ 87 officers , while a clean @-@ up for the general and the supervis@@ ors will be conducted for those officers .
for this , the de@@ si@@ g@@ nation of a c@@ ad@@ res , particularly until the rank of colonel , will be frozen .
a comprehensive investigation will be conducted before the term .
the file of 3@@ 7,000 officers is only to be opened .
a de@@ ser@@ ted study and f@@ et@@ tered members of the f@@ et@@ c will be uncovered .
officers who have no connection with the f@@ ta will continue their mandates .
the military will continue to fight until the last fe@@ ast has been cleared , and the promotion of the officers will be raised only after the investigation .
the investigation is being conducted by the mi@@ t , police intelligence and the state supervis@@ ory board .
the term of the officers who opened as part of the investigation complete the house of civilians or the military academy to study their duties and commanders .
they will also be investigated through an inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory study , which they say is not even a member of an i@@ te@@ m on the issue of ty@@ co@@ ons .
all measures will be taken to ensure that officers , who are not linked to the f@@ ta , are not affected negatively .
if the s@@ us@@ p@@ ici@@ ons are found to be the s@@ us@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble , he would be quickly clar@@ i@@ fied and transferred to the judiciary .
de@@ te@@ ction of n@@ m@@ d connections will be an@@ n@@ ul@@ led immediately with the military of those who have information and documents .
during all of these transactions , de@@ pos@@ it@@ ors will be frozen , while the review will be de@@ e@@ pen@@ ed .

the sky to be seen in me@@ te@@ or sho@@ w@@ ers
dr@@ . hasan es@@ en@@ oglu , a professor of national observatory in tu@@ bit@@ ak and a professor of as@@ tr@@ on@@ omy at istanbul university , said in a statement to one of the a@@ a con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors that per@@ se@@ id would reach the highest point , which con@@ ne@@ cts the friday ( august 12th ) .
thousands of songs intended for the impact of sun li@@ ghts and sho@@ w@@ ering from the qu@@ eu@@ ing star sin@@ ging &quot; s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly - s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly , &quot; es@@ en@@ oglu explained , adding that it would turn into natural s@@ cour@@ ge .
the per@@ se@@ id b@@ ust was first discovered in 18@@ 62 , and since the 1990s it was re@@ pa@@ i@@ red in the world , es@@ en@@ oglu said .
&quot; we need to watch such a vis@@ it@@ or @-@ like game that comes from space in july and august , &quot; said es@@ en@@ oglu , expressing the s@@ pec@@ tr@@ e of the re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ sion there during the past months .
con@@ se@@ qu@@ ently , this natural phenomenon has died .
&quot; the uni@@ ver@@ se will contribute to us to better recognition , &quot; he said .
with stan@@ do@@ ff , the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will hit the light
es@@ en@@ oglu took a attention from the fact that some of the pieces char@@ red during the g@@ lor@@ ious rain will fall to the size of the size of authority .
the re@@ fle@@ ction could range as many as 2,000 seconds .
due to heating and de@@ pen@@ den@@ cy in the atmosphere , per@@ se@@ cu@@ tions produce low levels in the natural environment , while tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure is tem@@ per@@ ed with white fl@@ our .

this data is worth of information because it is gathered anywhere in the world .

he reminded that the rain sp@@ il@@ led about 6@@ 0km at the polls , and said this s@@ pec@@ tr@@ e could have been monitored throughout the entire night , well from scar@@ ce areas in the direction of the east to the whole night .
more than 100 b@@ las@@ ts occurred annually , es@@ en@@ oglu said , after the def@@ en@@ sive ra@@ in@@ y ra@@ in@@ y it was between december 4th and 17th , it was worth a de@@ pre@@ ci@@ ative nature to watch the ge@@ ta@@ way .
former player erdogan educated , former foot@@ bal@@ ler
this balance was over@@ turned by the old pop@@ ul@@ ist sl@@ op@@ es , led by lon@@ g@@ time former foot@@ bal@@ ler recep tayyip erdogan , who won over 1,000 schools , colle@@ ctions of the institute for universities and education top gra@@ des that formed more than 1,000 schools , universities and education in te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ es .
an article from the above @-@ mentioned foundation , fo@@ re@@ ig@@ n pol@@ ic@@ y , published last week .
turkish football super@@ inten@@ dent erdogan , who has a university degree , is well @-@ educated and former foot@@ bal@@ ler ; gun@@ len , who holds his secondary education , has described u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ding as a widespread en@@ tre@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r , and has often become involved in western media reports .
after that , &quot; why increase america and / or western opposition in turkey ? &quot; in the tem@@ p@@ le articles , erdogan tries to clar@@ if@@ y what he started ...
an@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ism in turkey can be seen as news of turkey &apos;s history , which has come to mind as a ne@@ v@@ z@@ u@@ hu@@ r situation during erdogan &apos;s term .
in fact , given statistics , erdogan could be read during the first ten years as the period of action , at a time when western opposition in turkey fell or on average .
during those ten years , however , the united states and the united states have maintained good relations .
erdogan has criticised israel for his &quot; ha@@ ir@@ cut , &quot; which has been met with the turkish leader of the now @-@ def@@ un@@ ct pro @-@ kurdish government , the eu &apos;s top diplomat in syria , and the leader of the so @-@ called &quot; mas@@ termin@@ d , &quot; who has been fighting against a clear policy in the country after the crackdown on the syrian regime ended .
as a blo@@ o@@ dy coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at has lost 2@@ 47 people , let us lose no support until proof of the failure of the so @-@ called eu countries and the united states , as well as the united states , has let us forget about the fact that peace and stability are building in turkey , waiting for the establishment of peace and stability in its first official democracy and government .
but how will it be a month since many leaders from turkey -- including 11 char@@ lie he@@ b@@ do -- joined in paris to protest , because 11 char@@ lie he@@ b@@ do workers were killed , but how would you remember that turkey was not able to head any western country that had te@@ sti@@ fied against democracy only a month after 2@@ 47 people were killed in a coup that had been killed ?
what remains to be done to send lower levels of representatives of the heads or high @-@ level representatives who come a few times a year for the refugee issue ?
how can we assess the fact that all eu and us ambassadors went to the past , so that the mosque was broken down and that they did not have a solidarity visit to the bo@@ m@@ bar@@ d@@ ment of the turkish parliament ?
if the first two weeks of coup in egypt were when the eu launched a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at with its top representative s@@ pe@@ e@@ ding leader , s@@ pe@@ e@@ ding up a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at in the wake of ker@@ ry &apos;s coup at the end of the coup , &quot; if it re@@ members that turkey is concerned about the opportunities of turkey in both of turkey &apos;s western countries , which are no longer in support of democracy ?
even allowing 95 % of citizens to freely live freely in the united states , as those responsible for the coup , is currently keeping turks away .
if the back@@ drop i put forward , i think that the rising western / american opposition is obviously not to be explained only to erdogan .
&quot; moreover , erdogan has not even said that he thought there is an impact on the coup that is in the face of the united states ...
that to happen , isolation was ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated
h@@ um@@ ans , who per@@ ce@@ ive their own people as small and &quot; polling stations , &quot; sa@@ d@@ d@@ led with un@@ th@@ in@@ k@@ able voters like him , sh@@ ou@@ ting &quot; he@@ ar@@ ings &quot; that are out of the dark , and after 15 july , can they ste@@ al it from the same w@@ ise ?
after seeing how this people had a state and democracy , what was the question of &quot; where we were wrong &quot; ?
but is it so the question to be found ?
at various levels until the end of the world , ha@@ in was given the right to use the state &apos;s weapons , as well as officers , who were right to enter into state arms , and asked for re@@ fu@@ ge from foreign states .
we need to see how we live in a fra@@ c@@ tious atmosphere of mentality , and what kind of tactics that have taken the people into be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or they call people de@@ vi@@ l .
when it comes to the s@@ pec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar de@@ fa@@ mation attempt ...
was there any talk of re@@ qu@@ est@@ ing these actions along the lines of turkey &apos;s cities in syria ?
why why would one officer shel@@ l his own country &apos;s parliament ?
we should not have come down from de@@ c@@ lar@@ ations with m@@ ini @-@ de@@ c@@ lar@@ ations , such as waiting for appropriate be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
other pol@@ ic@@ y@@ makers , but let &apos;s be responsible for everything .
the p@@ ath@@ s that present politics as a fi@@ gh@@ ter of confron@@ tations , k@@ in and h@@ ate have done their necessary contribution to the tra@@ ge@@ dies .
they also presented themselves as &quot; intellectual &quot; and believed that every form of non @-@ rule was of law and even de@@ mo@@ graph@@ ics were natural .
we have finally seen how they opened fire on this public when h@@ ate were fired at the hands of their own people .
how we know democracy is the way we know
&quot; i say very simple . on the evening of july 15th , turkey &apos;s military ship from the people to the p@@ se@@ ed shi@@ r@@ kers , they killed 250 people and founded democracy , and built it only to save democracy .
but there are three deadlines behind july 15th 1992 @-@ 2002 , 2002 @-@ 2012 ; 2012 ; and beyond .
there are three changes set in this period : economic , social , political .
social change comp@@ iled two large ph@@ en@@ o@@ men@@ a : me@@ tro@@ pol@@ it@@ an migration of rural areas and moving to the centre after being kept in the surrounding cities for a very long time .
on wednesday , i speci@@ fied that this transfer was through the me@@ tr@@ o .
i have also emphasised that it is the most important social factor for a me@@ tr@@ o or not .
the second big change in the same direction was bridges and roads .
it is increasingly understood that the road and bridge contribute to modernisation .
the road is economic and social structure changing .
in us , too , he has changed his political structure .
i have been able to identify bridges that have or@@ che@@ stra@@ ted this landmark in istanbul .
de@@ mi@@ rel is the site of the bos@@ ph@@ or@@ us bridge .
this was the case in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s of the pe@@ as@@ ants &apos; movement in the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
oz@@ al remained the second bridge in which we changed his name to the 15 july mar@@ ty@@ rs bridge , in the same eastern part .
even along the route , they demonstrate the relationship between the surrounding -- and central .
that is a sign of how to follow a course of social change .
the ma@@ ch@@ ine of de@@ mi@@ rel and oz@@ al was at the centre for big crowds .
the centre was meant to send an en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m to them .
the ec party has not built its third bridge over the years .
because migration was going on at all pace .
people were placed in satellite cities .
a somewhat closed system was established in that area .
local ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tions in the ec party voted for people as an@@ n@@ ul@@ led , emplo@@ ys , social status , and then the coe party .
the mass was not ap@@ pli@@ cable in the centre , but it was asked to gain political awareness in the environment and to &apos; themselves &apos; after all .
the formation was in opposition to the ongoing debate among women in turkey in the run @-@ up to the ak party ( 1992 @-@ 2002 ) .
these debates have drawn fire from moder@@ n@@ ists , te@@ ars and fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ers , who have not been integrated into the centre , but rather from locals who stood by side @-@ by @-@ side .
the ec party acted in a method that i said after 2002 , pol@@ iti@@ c@@ ising the mas@@ ses , as@@ ser@@ ting politics , maturity and maturity .
after that , the score is now the wife of the democratic struggle on 15 july with the construction of the 3rd bridge .
it means history and soci@@ ology .
i could add another di@@ men@@ sion to this : the akp &apos;s move , which i mentioned , is not just limited to istanbul bridges .
it &apos;s more interesting : the akp is now bringing the surrounding cities into the centre .
this is being provided via two bridges .
one , the os@@ man@@ i bridge .
two , can@@ ak@@ kal@@ e 19@@ 15 .
add that .
turkey will now reach another route from th@@ race to izmir .
you know what to say , izmir will now be a ba@@ m@@ ot@@ h town after that .
let &apos;s take it from outside izmir , where he cannot obtain membership from the ak party .
now bur@@ sa , can@@ ak@@ kal@@ e , now th@@ race cities will be transformed into other cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men and social geo@@ graphy .
it &apos;s enough !
15 july mar@@ ty@@ rs are the stars of this great ad@@ venture .
van per@@ si@@ e and ne@@ sh@@ r@@ ine id@@ man in f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce
f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce continued to te@@ ach in the morning when he took part in preparations for the grand sh@@ op@@ pers game .
co@@ ach@@ es began at the can bar@@ t@@ u facility at 10@@ pm , in the management of coach vit@@ or per@@ e@@ ir@@ a . a total of 1 hours lasted 30 minutes .
the players , who took to the field after 30 minutes of cor@@ n training , were co@@ up@@ led with s@@ pe@@ ak@@ ers , s@@ prin@@ k@@ led by s@@ pe@@ ed@@ op@@ h@@ ers and heating , as well as the ti@@ e @-@ and @-@ p@@ ip@@ ing events at the hall .

he &apos;s the person to complain to st y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m ...
new developments on the match @-@ fi@@ x@@ ing operation against f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce have come to light .
hu@@ se@@ y@@ in il@@ di@@ ri@@ m , a journalist who participated in a programme run by cnn turk and announced that this operation was carried out by the f@@ et@@ c , &quot; has raised the words of sa@@ int y@@ ı@@ l@@ la@@ h il@@ di@@ ri@@ m , a sports figure , who is also a sports figure . &quot;
&quot; da@@ un@@ ting , one day on the plane , there is what happened next to sen@@ in fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la@@ h gu@@ len . &quot;
he tells setimes of his words by fe@@ th@@ ul@@ ar@@ ian sa@@ int y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m .
why did he wor@@ e st y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m ?
the head of turkey &apos;s largest ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ary , the club , thinks he can harm him .
the &quot; sch@@ o@@ ol@@ ing case was to liqu@@ id@@ ate st y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m , &quot; as he put it .
a statement following those remarks came from fa@@ ik is@@ ik , a key lawyer in the match for the match for match @-@ fi@@ x@@ ing .
ay@@ ik news appeared on the op@@ pos@@ ite position in turkey and revealed the comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y person who complained to f@@ et@@ c leader fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la@@ h gu@@ len .
that &apos;s what fa@@ ik fa@@ ik promises :
sa@@ int y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m says he is doing something to ih@@ san kal@@ kav@@ an about fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la@@ h .
he tra@@ v@@ els from azerbaijan , while on a private plane .
st be@@ y is a f@@ la@@ v@@ our man , where he also cri@@ tic@@ ises his cri@@ tic@@ is@@ ms .
that sen@@ ti@@ ment is perhaps a little poultry .
some of them can react .
these images are being raised one place .
the car@@ ol@@ s , h@@ im@@ me@@ t@@ ler , are so s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted to their f@@ av@@ or of the ha@@ c , like the one who went to the um@@ re .
they say they are neither a job ; they are highly critical .
this is not the only question , of course .
meanwhile , a football team is testing it .
it is the direct connection and the right thing of some football players and managers from the gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay club ...
mu@@ har@@ re@@ m veteran : to the mo@@ ther@@ mo@@ me@@ ter
tra@@ b@@ z@@ on@@ sport head mu@@ har@@ re@@ m u@@ c@@ ot@@ e extended his hand of friendship to f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce .
&quot; we are on the side of this country with 79 million . &quot;
we have to show a de@@ vi@@ l .
if f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce has a problem with f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , i am without justice , and i am for f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce .
&quot; but the match between tra@@ b@@ z@@ on@@ sport and f@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce is different , &quot; he said .
victim prices released
&quot; we as a union established kil@@ o@@ gra@@ m the price of kil@@ o@@ gra@@ m of the vi@@ br@@ ant victim , 18 li@@ ra , &quot; he said .
&quot; we also identified the price of can@@ na@@ bi@@ s as 15 li@@ ra , the same thing that we &apos;ve ta@@ u@@ gh@@ t as 17 li@@ ra , the second class , &quot; he said .
noting that animals that were not victims of last year were also put on sale , kar@@ ab@@ ul@@ u@@ t said the citizens had to pay attention to their sa@@ cri@@ fi@@ ce .
in particular , it has to pay attention to e@@ av@@ es@@ dropping .
it is also very important that the animal is healthy .
they can then control our citizens &apos; love while sa@@ cri@@ fic@@ ing the animal &apos;s passport .
in terms of its foreign outlook , it must also be a life and res@@ ili@@ ence of the victim .
and on the sur@@ face , one should not have signs like a s@@ m@@ ile .
in the past years , we have seen that animals that were not victims are being put up for sale and sold .
the animal , a victim , has to re@@ fill its age .
we can see this by taking care of the animals .
the f@@ us@@ s that a animal filled the age of 2 had been found as the cover &apos; .
but they didn &apos;t show up .
animal may be en@@ ter@@ ta@@ ined as a photo@@ grap@@ h , but tr@@ an@@ qu@@ il may be in@@ visible .
and if the ti@@ gers are already too small for others , they are quickly noticed .
ri@@ ze airport to be put to the sea
the second airport to be built in turkey with sea full will be built by ri@@ ze airport .

the ri@@ ze airport will be used for about 3 times more fil@@ ter@@ ing material than that used at the ye@@ sun airport , because the construction is too deep .
under the project , 36 planes will be built in the 4@@ 5m @-@ long , 3,@@ 00@@ 0@@ 0m @-@ long p@@ ist and ap@@ ron , which is supposed to run in the morning .

the ph@@ r@@ ase about robert am@@ ster@@ dam &apos;s f@@ here !
robert am@@ ster@@ dam , an official of the us @-@ based company for@@ be@@ s , which investigating international law in the f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ k terrorist group &apos;s ( f@@ et@@ ul@@ e ) illegal activities , provided an article to the us magazine for@@ be@@ s , sharing information on how the f@@ et@@ ul@@ e was organised .
n@@ one@@ the@@ less , f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ h gun@@ el is managing his organisation at fa@@ ul@@ t , according to am@@ ster@@ dam , which means &quot; the school of some 150 contract ( char@@ ter ) in the united states is quite clear how it works , the organisation &apos;s ability to gain hidden secret @-@ developed or@@ gan@@ iz@@ ation . &quot;
seven months ago , am@@ ster@@ dam reported that companies associated with turkey had been man@@ dated to investigate them and schools , stressing that what they found so far were &quot; sho@@ cking . &quot;
am@@ ster@@ dam included in the article :
the w@@ hi@@ r@@ ling man told us that his organisation has a strict hi@@ er@@ archy where instruc@@ tions have been issued .
the direc@@ tives were usually reported at face @-@ to @-@ face meetings in po@@ con@@ os .
the management group of seven people ( consul@@ it ) in the top .
they e@@ la@@ bor@@ ate on the advisory committee .
the instruc@@ tions are then headed to the regional ima@@ ms , their country ima@@ ms , pro@@ duc@@ tions , pro@@ duc@@ tions of towns in the country , or@@ gan@@ is@@ ms , man@@ us@@ cripts of their pre@@ serves , the image of students ( their homes ) and the students , respectively , and students to go to the homes of their homes .
businessmen , bu@@ re@@ au@@ cr@@ ats and officers are at different levels , depending on their positions and support from the organisation .
according to am@@ ster@@ dam , the organisation has opened 5@@ 5,000 jobs worldwide , making it the largest network of contract sub@@ missions in the united states , and says millions of dollars were granted to these schools every year from taxes paid by american taxpayers .
most of these money , am@@ ster@@ dam said , was lo@@ d@@ ged by organisation members and chan@@ ne@@ led into &quot; elected &quot; sub@@ contractors .
am@@ ster@@ dam says it is the same as in one case :
mag@@ n@@ ia school , a board in cal@@ i@@ for@@ n@@ ia , was arrested in the company , which is connected to the same office , providing $ 7@@ 00,000 for annual services .
am@@ ster@@ dam cited the do@@ ve science academy in ok@@ la@@ ho@@ ma as another example .
am@@ ster@@ dam noted that this school also paid $ 3.@@ 1m to the owners of property , as well as determined that it is made up of the school and the same people with links to the company &apos;s management .
according to am@@ ster@@ dam , the largest position in the network , there are similar situations in the 46 branch schools . he said more p@@ ay@@ r@@ ol@@ l companies are being paid for , including software licenses for smaller companies with links to smaller companies , cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ a .
am@@ ster@@ dam underlined that it was rich in one f@@ ta . &quot; my example indicates that about $ 2@@ 8m in mis@@ use of american taxpayers is mis@@ used , &quot; am@@ ster@@ dam said , stressing that she had become a rich member of the n@@ m@@ d .
&quot; and this is a visible part of our cl@@ ou@@ ds so far , &quot; he said .
noting that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents , am@@ ster@@ dam reminded that in his language , the situation had wor@@ sen@@ ed even more , with all of them began to investigate the irregularities of the te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ es of the te@@ ch@@ ni@@ que education agency .
am@@ ster@@ dam stressed that schools operate normal@@ ly , there are no information on how many employees are corrupt .
&quot; however , in fact , these schools are such as a s@@ no@@ w@@ ada@@ y@@ s , for the purpose of dealing with the school , &quot; am@@ ster@@ dam said .
&quot; the money that was then lo@@ aded on huge amounts is used for political donations to hide their la@@ w@@ less activities . &quot;
according to am@@ ster@@ dam , a former american teacher who worked for these schools , there were separate meetings among some workers in gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tors , and &quot; some of the members of the turkish armed forces are believed to be working on a similar course . &quot;
the coup protestors used to re@@ infor@@ ce their positions within the years .
&quot; however , it looked like the army was normal@@ ly doing business , th@@ er@@ e@@ by giving power behind a parallel force , &quot; he wrote .
am@@ ster@@ dam finished its article :
there are questions about the july 15th @-@ 16th events at the head of policy bu@@ sts in the united states , which are expected .
however , when the two allies are taken on a diplomatic level , it is necessary that those in the state authorities themselves fal@@ se@@ ly violate the us laws in their operations .

children pay attention to this ha@@ bit
serbian de@@ si@@ g@@ ner dr@@ . bil@@ gin gi@@ ra@@ y said the children are reli@@ ev@@ ed with this re@@ fle@@ ction , becoming a need for re@@ stra@@ int because they could not carry out the initial ad@@ ju@@ di@@ cation of the te@@ et@@ h .
l@@ isting the reasons for fin@@ ger@@ print cu@@ sto@@ m habi@@ ts in the children , dr gi@@ ray said , &quot; the police are a phenomenon that can be seen from three to 4 upon birth . &quot;
most ba@@ bi@@ es are e@@ mer .
to sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fy the need for em@@ be@@ z@@ z@@ le@@ ment , she said she would have her money to sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fy and enjoy her mother @-@ in @-@ law through the age of 1 to 1.5 .
&quot; it can be em@@ be@@ d@@ ded and act of fin@@ ger@@ prin@@ ting when it comes to self @-@ lies , when it comes to o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and re@@ mor@@ se , when it is gen@@ u@@ ine@@ ly and leave , it can act of monetary behaviour , &quot; he said .
stressing that she under@@ stands her in@@ comp@@ et@@ ence in the fundamental@@ s of em@@ be@@ d@@ ded em@@ be@@ d@@ ded em@@ be@@ z@@ z@@ le@@ ment and lack of trust in children , do@@ c dr@@ . bil@@ gin gi@@ y explains the den@@ tal health consequences .
being a par@@ ma@@ ti@@ m would have a negative impact on how the child &apos;s den@@ tist is shap@@ ed .
in the wake of pressure on the em@@ me es@@ cor@@ t , su@@ c@@ ces@@ sor@@ s may be pushed forward , while six of them have re@@ p@@ ly re@@ p@@ ly as a sub@@ sti@@ t@@ ut@@ e .
this would cause the su@@ b @-@ w@@ re@@ ath@@ s to be placed behind the sub@@ stance , th@@ er@@ e@@ by dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing the balance of the da@@ ma@@ l and den@@ tal structure .
the physi@@ ological re@@ fle@@ ction of this , however , would seem to be a f@@ an@@ tas@@ tic view of the de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation and closure .
&quot; we can preserve our children from development and pre@@ occup@@ ations without being finished , &quot; he said , noting that permanent t@@ us@@ ks could be faced with much more complicated treatment during the age of 6 @-@ 7 if there is no pre@@ ma@@ ture solution .
&quot; this is why the m@@ ou@@ th of children today , like monitoring and re@@ stra@@ int control of the children , needs to be kept under control , &quot; he said .
in@@ coming monitoring : new bre@@ ath@@ s : the stands
after kat@@ ar@@ ak@@ t treatment , patients do not wish to exercise re@@ stra@@ int nat@@ ur@@ ally .
the mar@@ g@@ ins , which have long been in our patients to address this problem , are already in use since long periods .
the in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tory tri@@ but@@ e of the treatment , which was recently introduced , made another step forward .
the margin of tri@@ g@@ gers from other cur@@ ren@@ cies is not only distant or close distance , but also a clear view of the oc@@ cas@@ ion@@ ally defined distance .
in@@ her@@ ited , close or oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ence from cl@@ ou@@ ds
the inter@@ rup@@ ted distance represents a main point in our daily life .
as an example , we are in the distance between the cur@@ ren@@ ts of cars , which are lo@@ g@@ ical and inter@@ medi@@ ary computers in our pu@@ p@@ ils , or at 60 @-@ 7@@ 0@@ cm per bar@@ re@@ ls .
they also rec@@ over from the tri@@ c@@ als , which do not need some kind of monitoring of our patients in any way , because they need them to make a close or remote difference .
another advantage that tri@@ m@@ med tri@@ but@@ e to tri@@ fo@@ k@@ al de@@ m@@ ons is to reduce their me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful complaints .
&quot; there is no difference from the regular treatment of tri@@ fo@@ k@@ al len@@ s treatment of every distance , &quot; said professor of eye disease dr vol@@ kan h@@ ur@@ mer@@ ic .
our patients , who are performing tri@@ fo@@ c@@ k@@ al treatment , will receive com@@ for@@ t com@@ for@@ tab@@ ly with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes .
and the next day our patients can return to their normal life .
it is an effort to improve the quality of life for people who use cars in particular , have p@@ len@@ ty of computers , want to read and live more actively .
you also resort to an eye @-@ in @-@ law expert to know if this procedure , which can be applied to every patient who has filled 18 years , is appropriate for you .

the lack of such da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters has no damage , and could thus be used for heart sur@@ ger@@ ies .

because heart is a very important body .
the presence of a var@@ i@@ ed gro@@ cer@@ y gro@@ om that was placed in place with surgery or in place , and deep ar@@ til@@ ler@@ y shel@@ ls de@@ cre@@ ases reduce the wor@@ k@@ lo@@ ad and will make the ba@@ by more healthy .

my message from oz@@ be@@ k to super@@ cup is me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful
dur@@ sun oz@@ be@@ k , president of the gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay sports club , issued a statement ahead of the super cup competition between gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay and be@@ si@@ kt@@ as .
dur@@ sun oz@@ be@@ k took the lead in turkish football to the unity and draw .
two long @-@ time , two @-@ observatory clubs in turkish sports , gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay and be@@ si@@ kt@@ as , will face the super cup in the kon@@ ya me@@ tro@@ pol@@ it@@ an arena on saturday ( august 13th ) evening .
this match was neither the first ever , nor the final game in the competition , which left our bi@@ en@@ n@@ ale behind the one .
but it &apos;s a vital challenge .
as we all know , our country bre@@ ach@@ ed a great father on the night of july 15th , night .
the coup attempt by the f@@ et@@ ul@@ la@@ h terrorist group / parallel state ( f@@ ta / p@@ dy ) that th@@ r@@ il@@ led all segments of society due to the unity and equ@@ est@@ rian unity of their society .
we paid heavy payments as a nation that night .
we are the mar@@ ty@@ rs .
we have a lot of veterans .
this painful re@@ me@@ dy reminded us of the importance of democracy again , the ne@@ ces@@ s@@ ity and importance of the dis@@ integration of the peace , not the conflict in these lan@@ ds .
representatives of turkish sports that night also met a single voice , a one against the coup , all along with democracy .
in these critical days , we need more than ever to com@@ b@@ ine sports .
i wish that this match , which takes place right back to the 2nd anniversary of our valuable r@@ ar@@ ity head sulejman se@@ ba and the club &apos;s new football season , named ef@@ san@@ e tur@@ g@@ ay , will be a favourite love for turkish sports and peace .
i wish it to be my country and turkish sports to win , regardless of the sport at the end of the game in front of the stands in which gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay and be@@ si@@ kt@@ as fans will co @-@ operate in front of the half @-@ staff .

sco@@ t cal@@ lu@@ m sk@@ in@@ ner flo@@ ur@@ ish@@ es in the house
the great br@@ it@@ an@@ ia team re@@ ta@@ ined the title the three great britain &apos;s team won from 2012 , while cal@@ lu@@ m sk@@ in@@ ner of s@@ k@@ in@@ ner from s@@ k@@ ina won the men &apos;s race in the ri@@ o race .
g@@ las@@ go@@ w@@ i , 23 , served as a leading ch@@ or@@ us by s@@ c@@ ot@@ r ch@@ ri@@ s ho@@ y of s@@ c@@ ot@@ land , and pro@@ u@@ dly returned to his home with her new ze@@ al@@ and c@@ lo@@ th@@ es , which was honoured .
britain was shocked by the event , which took five years ago , when he took the gold in six olympic reli@@ gi@@ ons .
and he was a retired man but repeated that , in march , he finished sixth in the world championship in london .
the problem between beijing and london was that of original ja@@ mi@@ e st@@ af@@ f , a speci@@ al@@ ist , was replaced .
they did so at a time when they could prove exactly en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m .
ho@@ y &apos;s retirement also set up a vac@@ u@@ um as k@@ ian e@@ ma@@ di and mat@@ t cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to fill .
he had previously seen his pot@@ enti@@ als achieved and had not given up his british coach sk@@ in@@ ner .
four years ago , he and his champion , h@@ in@@ de@@ s , set a new ze@@ al@@ and in the first round , although the country broke the olympic record in the race &apos;s round of ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion , along with ho@@ y .
and the three -- from britain -- came to the couple for the gold .
although it was a little bit behind in their own round , she brought the ken@@ ny team to it , and sk@@ in@@ ner was based .
much of the transformation that allows h@@ in@@ de@@ s to use a larger tool to slow itself down , allowing it to maintain a tem@@ p@@ o of ken@@ ny and , in particular , sk@@ in@@ ner &apos;s tem@@ p@@ o .
he was followed by his home as a bbc expert , and san@@ k over the po@@ di@@ um by sk@@ in@@ ner , ken@@ ny and h@@ ins .
&quot; this is an honour comparison , &quot; said g@@ las@@ go@@ w@@ l@@ u , 23 .
i am here just to give my best and announce the step .
in the final , we broke the olympic record and beat world champions .
it was really un@@ be@@ li@@ ev@@ able .
this is not a better way to win .
he admitted being out of the run@@ ner @-@ up following a poor start in 2012 , when london won a victory with ken@@ ny and ho@@ y .
that was followed by a response , and there was no way to sub@@ mit@@ ting a demand from britain &apos;s opponents .
this time around , there was no such problem for an inc@@ re@@ di@@ ble victory .
&quot; we were like in london with all great british flags on the table , &quot; he said .
we are a cal@@ en@@ dar just three months ago .
that &apos;s why we lost a lot of world ra@@ ces , and it is really inc@@ re@@ di@@ ble to have won the olympics .
it &apos;s only an event for a nation , which won seven of the 10 com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions in both beijing and london , and a medal .
the measure we have shown during the last five months is for us to finish in the race track and field .
his stance is that ho@@ y &apos;s dream of winning three gold records for a single olympics is not very impossible .
this , in turn , will mean six gold medals and a silver medal in can@@ ny , a british past g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ asi@@ um @-@ sports me@@ c@@ lis , who was born on march 23rd and was also born -- ste@@ ve red@@ gra@@ ve red@@ gra@@ ve red@@ gra@@ ve , mo far@@ ah and ro@@ ger ban@@ n@@ or -- when he was born .
that is the same level as ho@@ y .
ken@@ ny will now compete in the spr@@ int race ; the race will begin today and will last three days .
&quot; for the time being , i can only enjoy it .
the team event has had some of the best events .
you can win together with your friends .
fran@@ k@@ ly , people live alone because they live on their own .
&quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be awarded the k@@ night title , &quot; he said .
although this is only the event of this time around , there are many good news for the uk .
t@@ s@@ u b@@ rad@@ ley w@@ ig@@ g@@ ins , ed cy cy , ste@@ ven bur@@ ke and o@@ wa@@ in do@@ ul@@ l were the winner in the four @-@ kil@@ o@@ me@@ tr@@ e race .
he finished with 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 43 .
the world record 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 won the gold medal in 2012 .
the first round and final ( 22 : 42 ) will be determined in the second section of today , and will certainly draw more attention to w@@ ig@@ g@@ ins .
in the run @-@ up to the fe@@ at , officials had come at a stan@@ do@@ ff with him while urging him to we@@ ig@@ h his pa@@ ir .
the event of the women , which will continue and be completed , has a world record set by laura tr@@ ot@@ t , jo@@ anna ro@@ w@@ sel@@ l sh@@ ve , el@@ in@@ or bar@@ ker and mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ i@@ e , by k@@ ati@@ e ar@@ chi@@ e ar@@ chi@@ bal@@ d , who is serving at 4 : 2@@ 60 .
the great british team is counting on the powerful bi@@ cycle team to take the re@@ ins in the medium term of the olympic games and to win several medals .
expectations in ri@@ o have been lowered sharply , following great pre@@ c@@ is@@ ion in beijing and london .
the background has seen di@@ r@@ e development , which include the resignation of coach s@@ han@@ e su@@ t@@ ton in april due to the se@@ ver@@ ity and difficult accusations , and the retirement of key figures such as ho@@ y and vic@@ tor@@ ia pen@@ d@@ let@@ on .
it is the first night since the competition on the run@@ way , however , and the reputation of great britain for fin@@ ishing an excellent time will now be proven again .
s@@ us@@ pec@@ ting energy deal , future por@@ t@@ land iz@@ ab@@ e
the future of the por@@ t@@ land alumin@@ ium iz@@ ab@@ e o@@ ca@@ m in vic@@ tor@@ ia and the job of hundreds of workers in the company of energy sup@@ pl@@ ying all supply contracts at tes@@ tor@@ ia are in li@@ mb@@ o .
the move follows a decision earlier this year by the government in vic@@ tor@@ ia that the subsidies should not be overcome to continue the work of the facility .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old flat subsi@@ dy is in place in november .
al@@ co@@ a &apos;s por@@ t@@ land could be at risk , until 2000 .
the process of closure could lead to the fact that up to 2,000 jobs are directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly at risk .
and further chain effects could be established , as the whole of vic@@ tor@@ ia con@@ ge@@ s@@ ted about 10 per cent of its electricity .
in 2014 , al@@ co@@ a po@@ int hen@@ ry iz@@ ab@@ e closed her office , which led to the closure of the an@@ g@@ le@@ se@@ a power plant last year .
al@@ co@@ a &apos;s por@@ t@@ land iz@@ ab@@ e is losing money and now faces the risk of closure .
the developments emerged after years of speculation based on the strengthening of the australian d@@ ol@@ lar and the recent ins@@ pec@@ tion of the facility &apos;s consumer pay .
ag@@ l , who is at the lo@@ y yan@@ g power plant in the la@@ tro@@ be valley where he will sho@@ ot the great alumin@@ um , has said he expects the other three owners to move to termin@@ ate their contracts .
the vast majority of the facility belongs to the joint venture of al@@ co@@ a and al@@ um@@ ina , and china &apos;s ci@@ tic has smaller stakes in china and th@@ or@@ ny companies in japan .
&quot; ag@@ l expects the por@@ t@@ land facility to continue the work , which means that the iz@@ ab@@ e room will continue to seek physical power , &quot; he said .
the contracts , the ag@@ l said , were &quot; agreements on the risk balance &quot; that it must take effect in november 20@@ 16 .
they will be completed in 20@@ 17 because of a 12 @-@ month fe@@ ath@@ ers period .
&quot; for this reason , ag@@ l said , the contracts will continue to contribute in 20@@ 17 fiscal year , &quot; the energy company said .
the impact ag@@ l may be exposed to in 20@@ 18 financial year and after potential gains , which is limited to the adoption of a strong @-@ term contract for wh@@ ole@@ sale electricity prices .
ag@@ l said the value of the contracts in his accounts has already dropped by as much as $ 18@@ 7m because it is &quot; pending . &quot;
the decision on termin@@ ating the contracts &quot; does not affect al@@ co@@ a &apos;s ability to provide electricity to the business or land in the field , &quot; al@@ co@@ a said .
the us company signed a 20 @-@ year contract in 2010 , which was supposed to be en@@ acted in november this year , but has so far refused to explain whether it was contracted .
analysts are s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about the possibility of closure both due to the economic difficulties of the por@@ t@@ land iz@@ ab@@ e in vic@@ tor@@ ia and the to@@ ma@@ go facility near new@@ sw@@ ire .
responding to analysts earlier this week , ag@@ l &apos;s operations officer , stephen mi@@ k@@ ke@@ ls , said that por@@ t@@ land uses nearly 600 me@@ ga@@ w@@ at@@ ts of energy annually , and to@@ ma@@ go &apos;s nearly 900 @-@ me@@ ga@@ w@@ at@@ t energy .
should both of these facilities be withdrawn from the market , the demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market would lead to a significant reduction .
and as a producer , this would not be a good development for us , &quot; he said .
not only the star of the car@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an tv programme but the star of self @-@ proclaimed tv show ; it is the back@@ bone of vo@@ gu@@ e in september .
the fourth daughter of the kar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ j@@ en@@ ner group , the model and ad@@ min@@ ist@@ rat@@ or , an@@ ne k@@ ri@@ s , is at the door of his group &apos;s four anticipated september number .
he , a es@@ te@@ e lau@@ der mar@@ ka ambassador , who was a pa@@ ir of bo@@ y this week in the days of milan , paris and new york fashion , announced the news from his in@@ stra@@ m account on thursday .
&quot; when i looked at this door in a room full of people i lov@@ ed , i felt sor@@ ry , &quot; he wrote .
after the door was unveiled , the whole car@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ an @-@ j@@ en@@ ner family ( in bar@@ da ) was once again prepared by the gar@@ ner@@ stone and dz@@ af@@ ov world , which provided problems in the bar , and everyone &apos;s most lov@@ es , and a family b@@ lin@@ d video , featuring the producer r@@ yan se@@ ac@@ res@@ t ( either , or only a s@@ word of the s@@ mil@@ es , and a tri@@ but@@ ter party was preparing a last s@@ cri@@ pt .
although these almost all of the children &apos;s tv shows carry the &quot; birth day &quot; line up to the air @-@ to @-@ k@@ na@@ mes@@ e ( se@@ ac@@ res@@ sed at 8@@ am ) , &quot; don &apos;t forget our sen@@ ti@@ ment ? &quot; and i remember that some other girls didn &apos;t know how to know our other da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters .
certainly , we are entering this period of september and a new car@@ d@@ board .
k@@ im , his hand , may have come out in front of the vo@@ gur , which may have come out in front of the vo@@ gur , ( the door had been shared with his wife , kan@@ y@@ way west , in april 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s september day has been a success .
vo@@ gu@@ e &apos;s september number one sold out in the year .
it commemor@@ ated one fashion magazine and its book of her@@ o and a number of pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations ( fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able , fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a found the content of pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations in 6@@ 15 of last year &apos;s 8@@ 32 @-@ page volume .
it is also a closely watched process for opening the kap@@ it@@ an star ; pictures of the magazine have been le@@ ak@@ ed in the past two years ahead of the official announcement .
the women previously covered in the con@@ ta@@ in@@ er are na@@ o@@ mi c@@ amp@@ bel@@ l , linda ev@@ an@@ ge@@ l@@ ist@@ a and k@@ ate mos@@ s .
in recent years , the door has been given to ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ties that &quot; make a model &quot; rather than &quot; famous models . &quot;
os@@ car @-@ winning di@@ or ambassador j@@ en@@ ni@@ fer la@@ w@@ r@@ ence was at the door in 2013 , while the next year was told to la@@ dy g@@ ag@@ a .
however , even when she describes her generation as the &quot; f@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ling model , &quot; she can be said to be very good .
these ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ties are not young people , but they are all about the youth of today ( the rest of them ) , which can bring in relatives or reality by name in search of reality .
all of them are women who promote their skills in the entertainment field .
be@@ y@@ on@@ ce , located at the door of last year , spent some of his best mo@@ ments in le@@ mon@@ ade &apos;s arrival .
not everyone is happy with the success of j@@ en@@ ner .
because of the reality , the position of j@@ en@@ ner in the fashion world will always be dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ing .
in june , members of the original vic@@ tor@@ ia model ste@@ p@@ han@@ ie se@@ j@@ m@@ ou@@ r , j@@ en@@ ner and her colle@@ ag@@ u@@ e , gi@@ gi ha@@ di@@ d , ap@@ pla@@ u@@ ded them , calling them the &quot; cra@@ z@@ z@@ y of the time . &quot;
once there have been reports of whether j@@ en@@ ner would be able to get up to vo@@ gur , the idea has come to light again .
con@@ cen@@ tra@@ tion of dis@@ satisfaction , however , seems to be con@@ fu@@ sed .
it is the back@@ pack of vo@@ gur j@@ en@@ ner &apos;s september number .
he is exactly a super@@ model .
he heads to the books of mar@@ c ja@@ co@@ bs .

and in empty times , only his brother ko@@ ur@@ t@@ ne@@ y and his s@@ ons were also included on the tv set up to see their reality .
social legal support centres return 16@@ 0,000 people each year
the industry is preparing for the impact of more funding cuts in hard @-@ to @-@ do operations , as more than 16@@ 0,000 people in the most vulnerable part of the nation have been turned down from social legal support centres .
three out of five in qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and are refused -- mostly the elderly , migrants , immigrants , protected workers , those who have no resources to fight victims and unfair ev@@ ic@@ tions -- to offer free legal advice and representation .
social support services , which have de@@ ple@@ ted opportunities , are preparing for further cuts .
starting in june of next year , these legal support centres are scheduled to lose another 30 per cent of the federal financing .
social legal support centres director qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and director james far@@ rel says that the national union &apos;s final report of the national union &apos;s legal support centre de@@ te@@ c@@ ts thousands of people who are registered to be rejected every year .
mr. far@@ re@@ l said the situation would be much worse if the federal government decision is not rever@@ sed .
&quot; qu@@ e@@ en@@ as &apos; social legal support cen@@ ters receive ch@@ r@@ on@@ ically insufficient financial support , which means that thousands of people could not access vital services that are needed , &quot; he said .
people who fight against violence , against power and brutal forces that have roots in governance , are facing problems that are all related to legal di@@ men@@ sions that are free and off ... all those workers who are car@@ ele@@ ss for re@@ par@@ ations and who , according to this report , face help from the need .
the federal government , which will cut funding by 30 per cent starting in june 20@@ 17 , is forcing thousands of qu@@ e@@ en@@ ci@@ ers to deal with the more complicated legal problems of the thousands of qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and residents .
we call on justice minister and qu@@ e@@ en@@ sl@@ and sen@@ ator george bran@@ dis to regain those financing immediately so that people face a legal challenge .
last year , the government met its commitment to raising legal support to the national average .
now we need to look at the social legal support centres and the investments that the pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ uk government will work on this key task .
donald tr@@ um@@ p campaign team su@@ ed after personnel allegedly fired weapons
new york : donald tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign team has been su@@ ed for the fact that the director of north car@@ ol@@ ina operations did not take any action after he was told he had fired a staff of weapons while on a trip to ci@@ p in february .
the case was revealed wednesday in the case at the county court by the former software tra@@ in@@ er v@@ inc@@ ent bor@@ d@@ ini of the pro@@ vin@@ ci@@ al campaign team .
he said he expects to see a situation on the ground for months , but later realised this will not happen .
as he complained about bor@@ d@@ ini , the director cited e@@ ar@@ l philip as &quot; ex@@ plan@@ ation of an arms , ins@@ pec@@ ted the right @-@ wing signal , and carried na@@ il in the v@@ inc@@ ent gate of v@@ inc@@ ent . &quot;
according to the complaint , the bor@@ d@@ ini local and regional campaign team filed a complaint with its leaders , after having found at least four more people with phil@@ li@@ p and had the same experience .
&quot; there is no need for an fire to damage the weapons , &quot; he said in his complaint .
the trial was brought to the crowd in northern car@@ ol@@ ina two days after the pro@@ pon@@ ent of the republican candidate for president , who said that his rival for the post of &quot; second constitutional amendment &quot; ( in the arms owners and weapons supporters ) could take action if she decides to elect a rival hillary clinton and elect their judges .
tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s campaign team said it was ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating media on the basis of these promises and that it does not support the violence .
he is seeking compensation from the campaign team and from phil@@ li@@ p for its ob@@ so@@ le@@ te damage , due to be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or and ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ance .
tr@@ um@@ p &apos;s spokesman , h@@ op@@ e h@@ ic@@ ks , did not return s@@ wi@@ f@@ tly to the distance that requested his comment .
efforts to reach phil@@ li@@ p proved fru@@ it@@ less .
w@@ c@@ b , a local news inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ator in char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , recently declared that phil@@ li@@ p left the campaign .
his call for its consul@@ tan@@ cy , in@@ nov@@ ative consul@@ tan@@ ts in@@ nov@@ ative services , was not quickly rever@@ sed .

&quot; everyone can be familiar with intelligence , there is no information about the safety of the police , or it &apos;s up to the men to look after , &quot; he said .
the information has been launched , as part of efforts , by the interior ministry , the general directorate of police and the national intelligence agency ( mi@@ t ) .
by contrast , those who serve the f@@ et@@ c for the citizens will be able to pass through the organisation &apos;s activities , such a practice that would allow for safety and police .

control of property fund to be de@@ ba@@ ted
turkey &apos;s as@@ set fund , which is expected to be among the world &apos;s largest funds , was taken off a qu@@ i@@ et qu@@ ot@@ a law after appeals .
a re @-@ it@@ er@@ ation of the fund for lack of a monitoring mechanism has been decided , but has been negotiated again without any change .
ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating the akp @-@ funded turkish property fund can@@ un so@@ z@@ cu@@ .@@ com@@ . , chp mp and member of the budget commission ut@@ ku cak@@ i@@ vo@@ y@@ e , ev@@ al@@ u@@ ated the &quot; state property , pensioners &apos; pension cuts , employees &apos; will certainly be free of charge and we are res@@ or@@ ted to this structure , which will be comprised of constitutional control mechanisms for the unemployed , &quot; he said .
the turkish property fund can@@ un , which the government drafted to provide long @-@ term funds for investments and projects , was removed from the bar@@ ba law tuesday , when it said the opposition needed to further discuss it .
now , however , the akp has changed its offer to the plan and the budget commission .
s@@ m@@ m plan and budgetary commission member es@@ k@@ is@@ e@@ hi@@ r cak@@ i@@ ć explains chp mp ut@@ ku cak@@ i@@ ro@@ z@@ er to so@@ z@@ cu@@ .@@ com@@ .
&quot; when it comes to the plan for this fund and the draft law to the budget commission , our former finance minister , z@@ ek@@ er@@ i@@ ya te@@ mi@@ z@@ el , head of the chp delegation , has expressed our concern and concern , proposing that it be discussed in addition to tor@@ men@@ ting it from the law , &quot; cak@@ ir@@ a said .
the government accepted this view and withdrew the bill .
the bill came to the commission in the same state .
&quot; the government is insisting that it be removed from the parliament in a week , &quot; he said .
&quot; we are the biggest concern in this law , &quot; cak@@ i@@ ro@@ z@@ er says , adding that there must be a consensus regarding the creation of an as@@ set fund law .
&quot; assets which are state @-@ owned entities , pensioners , pensioners &apos; pension cuts , the unemployment fund for the unemployed , the pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ds from privatisation are transferred to a pro@@ ce@@ dur@@ al one which does not have any responsibility , except the assembly and the counting of any responsibility , &quot; he said .
he added that the funding was provided by russia , china and the g@@ ul@@ f countries &apos; oil revenues and trade , while the fund is funding that way . &quot; we have a savings deficit , &quot; he added .
that is why the fund will be comprised of public funds .
a total of 100 billion euros from the employment fund are planned to be transferred from the individual pension fund , which has to employ workers , and 50 billion euros from privatisation .
&quot; that is why this fund , which will be entirely em@@ be@@ d@@ ded with the public money , has to be under the control of the state and that money should not be ir@@ responsible , &quot; he said .
he emphasised that it is unacceptable for the fund to be kept out of the parliamentary control of a fund where state resources are collecting guarantees for the state &apos;s debt , and explained its concerns and concerns regarding the offer of the establishment fund .
the collection of such a large public as@@ set , spending , work and transactions related to borrowing on the part of the public cannot only over@@ run the control of independent control companies .
it is necessary to also include public control and a transparent structure .
proposed by the law , there are no provisions regarding the control and transparency of the assets fund by constitutional institutions .
no con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts were imposed on how much resources would be transferred .
no one can question how this fund was used .
it cited major projects as the aim of its purpose .
this means not an un@@ monitored fund , except for the budget .
why isn &apos;t you in the budget ?
&quot; why are &#91; it &#93; a mo@@ c@@ ker@@ y or a parliamentary control ? &quot;
he said that while he is one of the man@@ dated funds in the fund , they are not opposed to the chan@@ ne@@ l@@ ling of the money , but it is done with inc@@ or@@ rec@@ t , calcu@@ lated mechanisms . &quot; there is a need for such a fund . &quot;
but if the government insists that this is the ins@@ ist@@ ence , then we have to ensure that international standards apply in turkey , as well as in other countries where such investment funds are established .
it should be struc@@ tured in a way that the mechanism for control and accountability must be established .
there must be no tra@@ ces on which citizens can account until the end of their own money used to citizens .
&quot; we are pleased that the akp , in particular , is re@@ bu@@ ff@@ ing our criticism in the parliament after the &#91; 15 july &#93; coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , &quot; cak@@ i@@ ro@@ z@@ er stressed , stressing his sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly opposed to the proposal .
we hope that in this proposal we will listen to our constructive criticism .
we are against using the national pres@@ um@@ ption for the transfer , the transfer of those who use it without rule , and the lack of public control .
&quot; the ist@@ en@@ en wealth fund can only help if these concerns are addressed , &quot; he said .
he was found to have worked towards reaching a compromise between the akp and the opposition on the proposal .
&quot; we have investments that demonstrate the confidence in turkey
&quot; the investment of 30 billion t@@ l over the past five years showed our country &apos;s confidence in the future , &quot; ford auto@@ mo@@ tive board president ali ko@@ c said at a meeting in istanbul .
ko@@ c holding executive board chairman and head of ford auto@@ mo@@ tive board ali ko@@ c met with the head of the board of directors of several foreign companies , the istanbul industrial chamber ( i@@ so ) , to discuss &quot; people who trust in turkey , cre@@ ws in turkey . &quot;
&quot; we are putting our trust and trust with our partners in our countries , not only in the so @-@ called language , but also with our investments and fate , &quot; ali ko@@ c said at the meeting .
the 30 billion t@@ l investment we have over the past five years demonstrates our country &apos;s confidence in the future .
if turkey does not find itself to attract more foreign investment , it is a must -- a reliable and fair legal system , one that promotes democracy in international standards , qualified labour and r &amp; d , in@@ nov@@ ations , en@@ tre@@ pr@@ en@@ eur@@ ship , en@@ eur@@ ship and value @-@ added value .
in the past few years , our government has presented our most comprehensive incentives in our history of the republic .
&quot; i believe that we will be able to launch a new &apos; investment move &apos; that we need these incentives and territorial strategies , &quot; he said .
&quot; no more incidents are known now , not only a problem for a single country , but as global players , &quot; si@@ e@@ men@@ s industrial and trade council president and ceo hu@@ se@@ y@@ in ge@@ li@@ s said .
we came to turkey with a long @-@ term outlook .
our problems will be solved , if we have in unity and draw .
we were not able to bring in these lan@@ ds , which were 1@@ 60 years ago in turkey .
we will continue to go on in these areas .
&quot; of course we will build factories , but our s@@ cour@@ ge should be clear in this area , &quot; he said .
turkey is one of the top 10 countries for themselves , shel@@ l turkey country president ahmet er@@ dem said . &quot; turkey is among the 10 priority countries for shel@@ l , &quot; he added .
we believe in the potential and future of turkey .
we have invested and continued to do so in several areas , especially energy .
&quot; thank the president , our prime minister and our ministers for supporting international investors .
efforts are being made for international investors .
&quot; this is the direction to improve our country &apos;s competitiveness , &quot; he said .
san@@ do@@ z / nov@@ ar@@ ti@@ s will come to turkey &quot; our global ceo on august 10th , &quot; says dr@@ . alt@@ an de@@ mir@@ d@@ ı@@ l@@ an , president of the turkish and middle east region of san@@ do@@ z / nov@@ ar@@ ti@@ s .
however , travel postponed .
we , too , opposed it .
because ceo &apos;s arrival was very important .
the bul@@ let side car had asked for protection .
then when it took place , he saw that everything was normal .
he left his bo@@ dy@@ guard and car and was happy to return home .
investment in a country is similar to marriage .
first , if everything goes well , you are engaged in a do@@ g@@ matic and long @-@ term plan .
we are married to turkey and have no intention of div@@ or@@ cing .
the gap was turned into an i@@ te@@ m !
prime minister bin@@ ali y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m was speaking to businessmen by attending an consul@@ tation conference on &quot; people who have confidence in turkey , &quot; held by the istanbul industrial chamber at sw@@ is@@ s hotel .
turkey &apos;s industry , according to prime minister y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m , is the industrial sector that will lead to the state of its own . &quot; we should also keep in place the transition from the industrial sector to 4.@@ 0 , &quot; he added .
&quot; the value of added value is high , if it is important to serve as an engine of our country , and if it is important to achieve the 20@@ 23 goals , we will think about the industrial revolution , it and technology revolution , that &apos;s what we need to achieve . &quot;
&quot; those who are trying to destroy our country &apos;s future , stri@@ ving to destroy our democracy , blocking our gaz@@ i assembly , but they didn &apos;t give up on our quar@@ ry , but today we are talking about another turkey , &quot; he added , adding that turkey was returning to a large gap by the end of july 15th night .
we would talk about a turkey among the 3rd world countries that has been dealt with with in the coup management , have de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ated national wil@@ l@@ power , and have fallen out of the li@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ ian league .
&quot; we gave al@@ la@@ h the statement , with the de@@ di@@ cation of our nationality , our nationality , chief commander , our president , mr. recep tayyip erdogan &apos;s de@@ di@@ cation and commitment to our government , &quot; he said .
&quot; we will step in from the impact of this phenomenon and look ahead . &quot;
we are always living under a constant coup , and never is ac@@ cur@@ ate .
we have very ambitious goals ahead .
the coup attempt has shak@@ en turkey &apos;s economy .
ka@@ os and those who expected a crisis once again were li@@ t .
our democracy is also the s@@ pec@@ t@@ ru@@ m of de@@ vi@@ ation in our economy today .
the banking sector continues to operate in a healthy way , in our financial sector .
the foreign trade deficit in 2015 was down by 25 per cent .
the current account deficit amounted to 5.@@ 8 per cent in 2014 , while in 2015 the figure has dropped to 4.5 per cent .
we aim to decrease the goal to 4 by the end of this year .
we will never change our hard line at public finances .
turkey &apos;s budget of 20@@ 16 has also been higher than 130 other national income .
we have reduced the national income ra@@ ti@@ o to 1.3 per cent in 2015 and are stri@@ ving to keep those rates .
we have a better state of the public debt than the eu , a lot more than the world &apos;s .
our banking sector continues to be on a solid foot@@ ing .
&quot; despite our central bank , on july 15th , we did not need to exchange the market and our reserves any decrease , but we have a reserve reserve of over $ 1@@ 21 billion . &quot;
&quot; we are also carrying out comprehensive arrangements for the sake of better economy , for the sake of greater production and creation of new jobs , &quot; said prime minister y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m y@@ il@@ di@@ ri@@ m .
we have adopted , and will continue to do so , as we have implemented a lot of arrangements until the re@@ pa@@ irs of sto@@ ck@@ p@@ ile of sto@@ cks and unpaid tax debts .
&quot; produce for the country , continue to trust the country in your country , and you will continue to remove obstacles that are in front of your government , te@@ ch@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , &quot; he said .

turkey does not se@@ ver western turkey , does not give up the european union
mehmet simsek : turkey does not se@@ ver from the west , does not give up on the european union
&quot; those who rely on turkey , &quot; organised by deputy prime minister mehmet simsek , science and technology minister far@@ uk oz@@ l@@ u , economy minister ni@@ hat z@@ e@@ be@@ k@@ ci , ( i@@ so ) , attended a meeting on the &quot; man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ ers in turkey , &quot; held by turkish industrial chamber of commerce ( i@@ so ) .
&quot; i think there will be a lot of s@@ pec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar consequences for developments on the night and after 15 july , &quot; science and technology minister far@@ uk oz@@ l@@ u said at the meeting .
the bottom line is that un@@ dou@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ly whole union and af@@ fir@@ mation , which all of turkey feels deeply prote@@ c@@ table at the moment .
the 15 july process has shown how robust the turkish economy has to build on , and how inter@@ op@@ er@@ able , democracy has been .
&quot; for a society that achieved this level in the economy and democracy , the next process will be better and easier to move forward , &quot; he said .
&quot; you need to get ri@@ d of turk@@ i@@ y@@ e that ma@@ gic . &quot;
n@@ one@@ the@@ less , the 15 july coup d &apos;@@ af@@ fa@@ i@@ res from far@@ uk oz@@ l@@ u are hard to explain to the world , according to turkish economy minister ni@@ hat z@@ e@@ y@@ u@@ be@@ k@@ ci , who his government declared a mobil@@ isation of the issue .
z@@ e@@ ju@@ be@@ k@@ ci also highlighted the recent interest dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cies launched by the banks , &quot; if 6@@ 3.@@ 4 % of the first five percent of the real sector is going to hon@@ o@@ ur@@ ing , we should con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate all our power on this job , &quot; z@@ e@@ be@@ k@@ ci said .
for him , the president has returned , returning and work .
with the real sector , the banking system , with its government , politics , july 15th , is something that turkey has found unity and equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ a after the turkish civil democratic revolution .
and we welcome recent developments .
&quot; the monthly zero point in the period ahead with the en@@ cour@@ a@@ ge@@ ment of our president is for nine per cent ; and we will support this competition as an economic management , as eight of them , and we will carry out its sustainability , continu@@ ity and structure of power , &quot; he said .
&quot; gre@@ ver@@ b passport will make order for our ex@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he added .
&quot; in the coming period , we will be a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tor , &quot; ni@@ hat z@@ e@@ be@@ k@@ ci said , &quot; we will not leave the country , led by our president , for the sake of our prime minister , not , but we will leave no stone un@@ stolen . &quot;
we will leave no one we are in contact to increase our trade .
&quot; we will never and will never tol@@ er@@ ate it ; we will not be the birds after the s@@ us@@ p@@ ici@@ ons in the branch , but also the birds in the hand , &quot; he said .
z@@ e@@ be@@ k@@ ci also said that a green passport would be given to ex@@ por@@ ters during the times , adding that &quot; one of the latest decisions would be given to his law , which is now a law on economics ; from our exports , about 17@@ ,000 to 20,000 , and the green card which represents this country &apos;s exports from our first point of time , we would carry out our concession . &quot;
&quot; those who have been involved in a pur@@ su@@ it of coup communication require state contact . &quot;
&quot; but behind us , we now have to look at us , &quot; deputy prime minister mehmet simsek said , addressing the 15 july coup attempt and following o@@ h@@ al .
&quot; those who are involved in this coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at should be clean@@ ed by the state , and , more importantly , they needed serious administrative reforms to avoid any attempts to cra@@ ck down on such a coup , &quot; said simsek , adding that he was responsible for two simple reasons .
and then a state of emergency has been declared , and very serious structural reforms have taken place so far , as a climate necessary for these administrative reforms .
&quot; we have acted , will continue to act in the content of democratic principles and the rule of law , which is subject to all of them , &quot; he said .
as@@ ser@@ ting that life is normal@@ ising in many areas , simsek stressed that there are no small reasons for companies and individuals who have not engaged in financing terrorism .
according to simsek , the foundations of turkey &apos;s democracy are con@@ sol@@ i@@ dated . &quot; i think the foundations of turkey &apos;s democracy have become solid because when you look at the roots of recent past problems , you will see that the be@@ tra@@ y@@ al network has a job .
&quot; thus the removal of this terrorist organisation from the state would strengthen turkey &apos;s democracy , as this period is closed in turkey . &quot;
the foundations of the economy are generally robust , and in no way has come back to normal structural reform ag@@ en@@ das without delay , simsek says , adding , &quot; we have turned back to the attention of turkey &apos;s no@@ ble agenda , there will be progress in structural reforms . &quot;
structural reforms are already a must , since pop@@ ul@@ ism in the world is on the rise .
&quot; turkey can only prepare for the future by reform , &quot; he said .
finally , he stressed that turkey will not dis@@ band from the west . &quot; turkey can sometimes be at odds with our western allies , with our friends , but turkey is not dis@@ cour@@ aged from the west , but it does not give up on the european union , &quot; simsek said .

britain must re@@ direct its olympic spirit , expand he@@ ath@@ row
he@@ ath@@ row will offer renov@@ ations and prosperity not only to our local communities but also in london , as well as throughout the country .
i think it will be quite attractive to the he@@ ath@@ row , as in london 2012 , where we have made inc@@ re@@ di@@ ble efforts to benefit all nation@@ alities and territories .
the olympics have created great advantages for str@@ at@@ ford and the east end .
and we will achieve this again , creating opportunities for the local people and firms close to he@@ ath@@ row .
we will only provide 10,000 new inter@@ n@@ ally for our local community , create 40,000 new jobs and leave no young people jobless at the airport .
as in the case of london before 2012 , some will think the struggle to expand he@@ ath@@ row is too difficult .
i was told that britain was never able to prepare for the games , and that we would be a reality throughout the world .
the s@@ us@@ p@@ ici@@ ons were burned in 2012 and will be seen as a result of he@@ ath@@ ing in he@@ ath@@ ing .
there are obstacles that have always to be overcome , but he@@ ath@@ row answers to all questions that have been asked .
as in the olympics , he@@ ath@@ row is not only a few people but a infrastructure project for many .
the expansion gives 18@@ 0,000 new jobs and an opportunity to create economic growth of 2@@ 11 billion euros , leaving many skills and jobs both in the airport environment and throughout the united kingdom .
we have a won@@ der@@ ful team from ta@@ th@@ ro@@ w to t@@ 2 , which has been named the world &apos;s best airport terminal for five years , in time for the world &apos;s two fas@@ test track and field , and the implementation of an investment worth 11 billion euros eligible for the budget .
now we are ready to offer a third track track track and field , supported by special investment worth 16 billion euros .
the london 2012 games were a great success for the united kingdom , and i have no doubt that the he@@ ath@@ ing of he@@ ath@@ ing will also occur .
it is time for us to create many capabilities and business capacities for the olympic spirit that we will rely on the expansion of he@@ ath@@ row , allowing us to secure our trade future and to take pride in britain .

ad@@ blo@@ ck plus &quot; like the ke@@ g @-@ f@@ are game &quot; to block facebook ban
according to one of the companies trying to block advertising for online adverti@@ se@@ ments , the &quot; ke@@ di @-@ f@@ are game &quot; is being re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced it would block pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations on its mas@@ ters &apos; mas@@ k today , ad@@ ck plus published a blo@@ g that says users may up@@ date their fil@@ ters in order to stop adverti@@ se@@ ments in the social network .
facebook said on tuesday that it would change s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ ca@@ ted co@@ des on the environment to make it more difficult for a portion of the pu@@ b@@ l@@ ish@@ ers to identify the bil@@ l@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds .
however , he now says he has resolved new co@@ des .
in a blo@@ g post @-@ blo@@ g message , ad@@ block spokesman be@@ n wil@@ li@@ am@@ s said that &quot; this is going on from the very moment since it &apos;s been inven@@ ted to prevent a further rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence of the open source adverti@@ se@@ ments between the and those who tried to prevent a further rec@@ ur@@ ring between the community and those who tried to prevent them , &quot; and made it possible on facebook &apos;s own solution in a close time .
the involvement of the largest social media company in the world shows how much concern has been raised for the industry by adverti@@ ser@@ s .
about 200 million people are using pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations as a global phenomenon , four times more than that type of software in 2013 , according to a study by pa@@ ge@@ or@@ ge@@ s@@ ted and ad@@ o@@ be last year .
active users and mobile adverti@@ se@@ ments ac@@ coun@@ ted for 1.@@ 03 billion daily on facebook with mobile goods and 84 per cent of facebook &apos;s advertising income .
because mobile advertising is not effective on facebook for the social network and in in@@ st@@ ag@@ ra@@ m , the company has been watching the re@@ ci@@ p@@ i@@ ents of pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ations on the table , according to a spokesman .
with facebook seeing it worth investing in such a move , massive adverti@@ se@@ ments should still be in place .
also on tuesday , facebook said it would up@@ date its &quot; adverti@@ se@@ ments &quot; tool in order to better control the adverti@@ se@@ ments offered for them .
on thursday , facebook claimed that the new fil@@ ters of the ad@@ ck were al@@ ar@@ ming , and that it would ham@@ per part of the pu@@ b@@ li@@ city on the site .
&quot; it does not offer good experience to these people and we are planning to deal with this problem , &quot; a facebook spokesman said in a statement , issued with e @-@ mail .
we are focused on creating vehicles such as advertising pre@@ fer@@ ences in order to provide people with coal .
a woman runs out to swiss highway , as the case appears to have committed suicide
at mid@@ night , the victim was on the highway .
in what appears to be a suicide case , police sought earlier thursday people who personally tor@@ e up a few cars on the highway on the road .
the incident occurred in the v@@ au@@ d can@@ ton near mor@@ ges , shortly after mid@@ night on thursday .
v@@ au@@ d police said a woman was found &quot; hel@@ p@@ less &quot; on the site of the night &apos;s s@@ me@@ l@@ l and a few cars were hit by her .
a few cars were broken up , including a truck , to the 49 @-@ year @-@ old swedish woman , who was obviously seeking re@@ bel@@ lion .
he died on the scene .
police have said they have discussed some of the drivers involved , but some of them have not been identified and have requested that all those involved , including them and involved , resort to themselves .
in a statement , attorney gil@@ les ho@@ f@@ ste@@ f@@ ste@@ f@@ ste@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ter told the tribune that &quot; a reasonable &quot; when it comes to situations like this , a criminal prosecution was opened for gen@@ es .
it remains to be seen , however , whether drivers involved in the incident will face any charges .
was it possible to avoid before fighting ?
this is what the prosecutor should identify , &quot; he said .
two similar cases during the past five years demonstrate that drivers will not be held responsible .
both cases ( the paper included a person who headed on a road in the dark ) was ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment that it was not normal for drivers to wait that a spread on the highway in the mid@@ night road .
last year , he pleaded not guilty to the death in august 2014 due to a be@@ ar@@ ings by a policeman who caused a man on his way through a p@@ ip@@ e near p@@ aj@@ ne , in a bat@@ h of a1 .
the court said that the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a liqu@@ i@@ da@@ tion and was in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating .
the court said that using the mid@@ d@@ le@@ man &apos;s tool in the response to an emergency call , and that finding a man on his path was &quot; totally ex@@ cep@@ tional and un@@ predi@@ c@@ table . &quot;
those who were familiar with this incident , which took place near mor@@ ges on thursday , should police search for 0@@ 6@@ 83 or 3,@@ 6@@ 44 of the se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts .
nas@@ a climate model : good measure for life once
according to new nas@@ a climate model projections , there were some conditions for life in ven@@ us .
scientists at the nas@@ a go@@ d@@ dar@@ d institute institute for space space development developed a model to explore ven@@ us &apos;s past , using similar instruments and al@@ gor@@ ics used by cli@@ m@@ bed scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether ven@@ us once had hosted similar conditions similar to those in the world , with war@@ f@@ are , war@@ m@@ th , water and the atmosphere of co@@ 2 .
scientists explained the past with a th@@ ic@@ k s@@ pec@@ tac@@ u@@ lar tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure lay@@ er of ven@@ us .
however , the newest pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is suggests that , under the ven@@ us , it could have had a world @-@ like atmosphere , and could still be slow .
the model also sought the ar@@ til@@ ler@@ y of the old ven@@ us .
although the plan@@ et may have origin@@ ated in the region , it may have already been a source of rapid be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or against adequate sea and geo@@ graphic change .
the old inven@@ tion was also used to take advantage of a wider sun , which is 30 per cent less lo@@ b@@ b@@ ying .
&quot; the slow return of the g@@ is@@ s model of ven@@ us to ven@@ e@@ ti@@ an rule @-@ of @-@ day vi@@ g@@ or every two months was bringing the side back to the sun , &quot; g@@ is@@ s scientist an@@ th@@ on@@ y del gen@@ io said in a new@@ s@@ letter .
that , in turn , led to tor@@ ches such as a um@@ bre@@ l@@ la that has spread the face , protecting the face in the face of sun @-@ stri@@ c@@ ken oil .
as a result , only a few degree of di@@ r@@ e tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure today sur@@ faced with the prospect of the world .
the model has brought the introduction of a similar story on the evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary that had previously put forward the de@@ po@@ t as a hi@@ p@@ o for the plan@@ et .
although it once had appropriate conditions for life , it has suffered too much water and ul@@ tra@@ s in the past few years .
the o@@ mission was de@@ ple@@ ted , and the water was burned to light by the light of the li@@ me@@ li@@ gh@@ t .
hy@@ dro@@ gen has been ex@@ ha@@ us@@ ted and the car@@ b@@ on @-@ full car@@ b@@ on pla@@ in , which only has the le@@ th@@ al effect of le@@ th@@ al green@@ house gas , remains an environment we know today .
researchers shared the results of a new ven@@ us climate model in their articles on ge@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ cal research .
patri@@ ck ro@@ y steps down from av@@ al@@ an@@ che an@@ ch@@ or
patri@@ ck ro@@ y said the team was not given a say in the decision making process , and resigned on thursday from the post of vice president of col@@ or@@ ad@@ o av@@ al@@ an@@ che and ho@@ key operations .
col@@ or@@ ad@@ o vice @-@ president / director jo@@ e sak@@ ic approved this development , and said the club will begin to search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; over the past three years , i have fulfilled my co@@ ach@@ ing duties as vice president of col@@ or@@ ad@@ o av@@ al@@ an@@ che , with energy , pas@@ sion and determination , &quot; said ro@@ y , 50 .
i &apos;ve thought how i could improve and how to reach a higher level through the de@@ p@@ th of that team during the summer .
achieving this , they must ensure that the vision of ko@@ c and v@@ p ho@@ x@@ ha@@ j operations is f@@ la@@ w@@ ed in a f@@ la@@ w@@ ed harmony with the organisation &apos;s vision .
it must also have a say in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance .
current conditions have not yet been met .
kat@@ an sak@@ ic , who joined his team on may 23rd 2013 , thanked ro@@ y for his contribution to the team .
&quot; i no@@ tified me of my decision today , &quot; he said .
we thank him for everything we do for our company and wish him good lu@@ ck in the future .
ro@@ y was awarded the jac@@ k ada@@ ms tro@@ ph@@ y for av@@ al@@ an@@ che in the first season , between 2013 and 14 , for best co@@ me@@ dy .
the club scored 1@@ 12 points and made it to the team &apos;s league first @-@ place finish , but was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ y @-@ off period , qu@@ ali@@ fying for min@@ ne@@ s@@ ot@@ a , as a result of the season every two years .
av@@ al@@ an@@ che spent a period of 39 @-@ 39 , 16 @-@ 4 target in 2015 @-@ 16 , and a score of five than necessary for the second jo@@ ker field in the western conference .
kal@@ ec@@ i ro@@ y , on the honour list , won four stan@@ ley cup -- two for mon@@ tre@@ al can@@ a@@ di@@ ens and two for av@@ al@@ an@@ che .
oil workers in the north continue negotiations , s@@ us@@ pen@@ ding strike
the strike was put on hold because of the pay of oil workers in the north sea , and the chief negotiators began to debate a new round of talks .
the strike against the oil field company wood group is p@@ has@@ ed in pla@@ t@@ forms in the north sea , operated by the royal dutch shel@@ l .
&quot; we have decided to re@@ start the process for the resolution of the existing dispute with the wo@@ o@@ d group as union and r@@ m@@ t unions , &quot; a joint statement said .
in the next few weeks , we will hold a series of sessions to take a new look at the problems , starting next week .
labour unions have said that this protest in the face of salary cuts that could reach 30 per cent is the first actions since 25 years .
this year , wood group cut by nearly 9 per cent the payments to contractors in the north sea due to adver@@ se pressure on the market .
a 10 per cent cut was also imposed on lo@@ ads on the coast in 2014 , after the company &apos;s wage cut process .
additional ou@@ tages , the company said , would provide the company with room for a transition from a difficult period in the market .
shel@@ l dismissed thousands of people as part of the integration process with the british energy company b@@ g group , and announced plans to lay off oil and gas operations in the country by 10 .
energy companies are under pressure due to the low price of cru@@ de oil , an economic situation caused by britain &apos;s decision to split from the european union in june .
da@@ ve an@@ der@@ son , a member of a s@@ c@@ ot@@ ti@@ s@@ h parliament , is scheduled to meet with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the north sea .
as he says , the north sea is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; we need an effective economy in the north sea and the majority not for the minority in the country as a whole , &quot; he said in a statement .
despite the average investment of around $ 7 billion over the past five years , new projects in the north sea are expected to be less than $ 1.4 billion .
b@@ ish@@ op@@ s we@@ ig@@ h measures team @-@ star stars &apos; return speed
the ke@@ p@@ ler space tele@@ scope helped make scientists the most complete contribution to the return speed of the team star .
new data helps ec@@ ologists mo@@ ur@@ n the team @-@ star stars at a rapid pace and realise the evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary times of their return .
&quot; compar@@ ing our consequences with star can@@ di@@ da@@ cies , a star was able to learn more about the relationship between poultry , age and even the sun system , &quot; lu@@ isa re@@ bul@@ l , a research scientist at cal@@ te@@ ch &apos;s centre for red @-@ trans@@ national processing and analysis at the pas@@ ad@@ ena centre in cal@@ te@@ ch , said in a new@@ s@@ letter .
the ul@@ ker team star is 4@@ 45 years away from the world .
most of the stars at the team night formed 12@@ 5m years ago , and are reaching the level of new access .
they return at the highest pace for their lives .
at the peak pace of return , stars at this stage of maturity make up a large amount of star .
these win@@ ds have a breaking effect on the stars as they move forward in man@@ ye@@ tic areas of the stars .
as a star appears to be old , the speed of return is starting to pl@@ um@@ met .
the b@@ ish@@ op@@ s are me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing the deadline between the apparent vi@@ e@@ w@@ points and the appearance of each star &apos;s fe@@ at , such as solar le@@ ks .
the latest co@@ me@@ back speed makes it easier for larger stars than smaller ones .
re@@ bul@@ l said that the stars were similar to dan@@ g@@ ling dan@@ c@@ ers , allowing large ones to return more slowly than just ones .
&quot; we see that those who are slowly returning to the ul@@ ker &apos; hon@@ e@@ y are much tou@@ gh@@ er and very mil@@ d stars , &quot; re@@ bul@@ l said .
the ul@@ ker team has become an ideal co@@ in la@@ b for compar@@ ing the pace of return , with its pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity as long as it is too close .
&quot; ul@@ ker is young and older of the team star , providing the@@ o@@ re@@ tical models for star returns in both direc@@ tions , &quot; re@@ bul@@ l said .
it is much more that we want to know how to speed up their return speed , how and when it ended up , and then we &apos;d like to know why &apos; we left their dance sho@@ es &apos; a do@@ g .
re@@ bul@@ l and his colleagues described the latest analysis of the team &apos;s return speed with details available in the three new articles to be published in the magazine of as@@ tr@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ ical .
